[409.64] the server please if you are already on
[413.24] Discord please join us guys all right
[416.72] today's topic is very interesting
[418.76] because Muslims always tell us that you
[422.08] cannot lust after married women in Islam
[426.44] but if we can prove that Muhammad did
[428.28] that that means
[430.32] Muhammad
[431.96] disobeyed Islam disobeyed the religion
[435.96] of Allah and he disobeyed Allah and
[438.44] which proves that Muhammad is above
[441.36] Allah above the Quran and above
[444.56] any law in Islam what does that make him
[447.72] it makes him not only equally Divine
[451.56] with Allah but actually higher than
[453.12] Allah so who's the real God
[457.28] then if Muhammad can break rules what
[461.60] does that make him are rules to be
[464.28] broken in Islam very easy and important
[467.80] question right
[471.36] guys and maybe that's one another topic
[475.44] another question that
[477.20] should allow Muslims to think
[481.12] should you stay a Muslim in
[484.32] 2024 and we are about to join a new year
[488.72] 2025 Muslims is Islam compatible with
[493.16] today's life today's way of thinking
[497.60] human
[499.32] nature should you follow Islam if you're
[503.16] someone who seeking the truth would you
[506.60] follow
[508.20] Muhammad if if you just look at the
[510.32] morals of Muhammad and his actions that
[513.20] we can find in Islamic
[517.04] books right my Muslim friends and I see
[520.20] often many Muslims because they
[522.64] are very embarrassed about what the
[526.32] Hadith say the Sunnah that we can find
[529.32] in the Hadith about Muhammad all of
[531.76] these reports because they're getting
[533.84] embarrassed they are still a little bit
[536.24] stuck often they will become Quran only
[539.04] Muslim
[540.04] right you have heard of this new
[541.40] movement they become Quran only because
[544.04] they see the problems the problematic
[546.28] the dilemas in the Sunnah of Muhammad
[549.08] right which is the teaching and
[550.24] tradition of Muhammad so because they're
[552.68] so still stuck they they for some reason
[557.28] I don't know why I've always asked
[559.24] myself that question why would you still
[561.76] be stuck in Islam finding out Muhammad
[565.00] is
[566.00] one filthy Son Of Satan basic basically
[570.36] why would you still cling to Islam why
[572.88] don't you leave why why are you still
[575.20] with one leg in
[577.28] Islam is isn't that
[583.60] hypocrisy no no uh pidi would be
[587.64] compared to Muhammad pidi is cute do not
[590.56] insult pidi and calling him uh you know
[594.24] associating him with Muhammad because
[596.20] Muhammad is far more worse okay P did
[600.28] would have be
[603.64] cute let us say hello to our friends in

[1133.60] peace civil calm discussion mhm well why
[1138.08] why need do you need to see to say that
[1140.28] I mean uh is that because most Muslims
[1143.16] insult you or something or well no well
[1146.40] most Muslims do insult but when I was on
[1148.64] the uh live with the Christian Prince he
[1152.20] was very rude so I'm going to talk to a
[1154.84] Christian I just want to have a
[1155.92] respectful conversation well Christian
[1157.36] Prince is not here so it's really uh
[1160.28] very cringy from you to use somebody's
[1163.24] else's name while he's not here so do
[1164.88] not do that my you ask me okay I won't I
[1167.52] didn't ask you for Nam so it's very
[1169.52] awkward and very embarrassing to be
[1171.40] honest with you I'm going to be honest
[1172.60] with you to use somebody else's name
[1174.88] who's not here you know it's not really
[1176.84] men talk about other men while they're
[1178.72] not here right you agree right you're
[1180.20] talking about you talking about Muhammad
[1181.92] Muhammad's not here but that's okay
[1183.44] let's just go okay oh so we should not
[1186.32] talk about Muhammad at all we should
[1189.32] these are your rules not mine I thought
[1191.52] you Muslims need to do da for us let's
[1194.56] let's talk about the topic okay naid you
[1197.20] sound like a Muslim are you a Muslim
[1199.96] I believe in the Quran I uphold the
[1201.76] Quran okay what about the
[1203.68] Sunnah I do not follow the Sunnah I'm
[1206.60] sorry why did you reject the sunah and
[1209.16] read well in the Quran the only Sunnah
[1212.44] is God's Sunnah it never says to follow
[1214.56] the sun of Muhammad there's no such
[1216.84] thing in the Quran okay and the Quran
[1219.36] says which Hadith other than this do you
[1221.08] follow so I don't follow any other had
[1223.52] okay naid uh so just to you know because
[1227.48] you're a Quran only Muslim
[1229.48] why did you become a Quran only
[1232.40] Muslim I'm interested to know I well I
[1236.16] just became a submitter I mean I saw the
[1238.28] Quran I thought it's beautiful and
[1241.52] um the message of the Quran resonated
[1244.08] with me so I didn't see a reason to
[1245.68] reject it okay but why did you why did
[1248.20] you reject the
[1251.12] Sunnah I think it's
[1253.76] indefensible uhhuh so because it's
[1255.92] indefensible that's why you chose to
[1258.04] reject it
[1259.36] well I told you God rejects it in the
[1261.16] Quran right which is
[1264.00] there so chapter six verse
[1268.36] 114
[1270.12] chapter can you read it for me please
[1273.32] yes I seek refuge in God from saying the
[1276.04] rejected now I seek other than God as a
[1278.76] source of law when he has revealed to
[1280.52] you this book fully
[1282.20] detailed fully detailed okay now can you
[1285.72] read them for me chapter 53 I three and
[1289.88] four of course mhm three says nor was he
[1294.92] speaking out of a personal desire it was
[1297.84] it was divine inspiration the next verse
[1301.00] is dictated by the most powerful so
[1303.32] dictation is for the literal word of God
[1305.12] that would be the Quran go ahead okay so
[1307.68] who is who who is this Ayah talking
[1310.60] about in 53 that's
[1313.32] Muhammad okay I will give you a million
[1315.36] dollars if you can show me from the
[1316.52] Quran that it's about Muhammad
[1321.72] you see what you did to yourself who
[1323.44] yeah who else so you see how you so you
[1325.12] see how you are not so you see how you
[1326.60] know the Quran only Muslim do you have a
[1329.12] million dollars uh I said I'll give you
[1332.16] a million dollars if you can show me
[1335.40] about Muhammad yeah how can you give me
[1337.76] something you don't have right so so you
[1340.44] see you see what you're doing now you're
[1341.68] not
[1342.40] deflecting you said you're a Quran only
[1344.88] Muslim prove to me that this is about
[1346.76] Muhammad
[1349.00] you see how you're stuck without let's
[1351.00] do it no no no let's do it let's do it
[1354.28] okay 472 no no no no don't run I I'm
[1357.88] asking you about this this one is yeah
[1361.32] yeah and the Quran is over 6,000 verses
[1363.92] right so we have to look at the verses
[1365.68] to come to conclusion about other verses
[1367.48] no no no wait you said that this is
[1369.16] about Muhammad it how do you know this
[1371.56] is about
[1372.56] Muhammad among many how do you know that
[1374.68] this is not about how do you know this
[1376.44] is not about Moses look at
[1380.20] 472 so you need to go to other chapters
[1383.16] to understand this Ayah yes yes we
[1386.28] should not look at one verse in
[1387.52] isolation we have the whole book to
[1389.52] examine no problem so you see guys he
[1391.76] needs to go to outside sources it's not
[1395.00] an outside Source it's an outside Source
[1397.00] because you 472 is another verse no this
[1399.92] we're talking about chapter
[1401.96] 53 all right you can go to other verses
[1405.52] you can go to other verses in no you
[1407.04] can't in this case you can because
[1409.44] because this is about the star this
[1411.24] chapter is on itself you just you just
[1413.40] made arbitrary rules okay so you see
[1416.60] what you're doing you as a Quran only
[1418.60] Muslim you are stuck in the middle
[1421.16] because you don't know about let's
[1422.56] assume this about Muhammad I'll go with
[1423.96] you no problem I I'll grant you that
[1427.84] okay okay and he speaketh not of of his
[1431.08] own desire so Muhammad does not speak
[1433.60] out of his own desire right
[1441.08] right that's right but everything that
[1443.68] comes out of his mouth is divine
[1445.28] revelation from
[1447.48] Allah everything related to the Quran
[1451.60] okay so are you saying what you're
[1453.24] saying is that Muhammad when he woke
[1455.56] when he was awake in the morning
[1458.16] everything that comes out of his mouth
[1459.68] is
[1460.88] Quran no absolutely not well that's what
[1464.36] your logic is Muhammad committed sins
[1467.32] this is recorded in the Quran that has
[1469.04] nothing to do with the with with this
[1471.00] problem the problem is you said you only
[1473.44] follow the Quran here it says that you
[1476.40] have to accept everything that comes out
[1479.40] of the mouth of Muhammad as divine
[1481.04] revelation so that means you have to go
[1483.92] to the sunah it's referring to the Quran
[1487.52] brother it's referring to the Quran so
[1490.04] when
[1490.88] Muhammad okay just second when Muhammad
[1493.72] woke up and he said to his baby bride AA
[1496.72] or any other wife uh good morning it's
[1499.88] divine revelation from Allah baby baby
[1503.04] bride yes where did you get that from
[1506.48] that Aisha was a baby bride okay where
[1508.04] do you get the name Aisha from I don't
[1510.56] need it I don't need it see see guys he
[1513.36] knows about a he knows about but he
[1516.36] can't find the name AA in the Quran
[1518.20] Bingo no I don't no no no no I don't
[1520.48] need it how does that benefit my relig
[1522.76] dam it yeah let's not let's not make
[1525.72] noises so what difference does it make
[1528.36] make knowing the name Aisha let's say I
[1530.08] don't know that name can I not get
[1531.56] salvation without knowing the name Aisha
[1534.48] God tells us in the Quran we have
[1535.80] everything we need for salvation this is
[1537.68] the book of Salvation the name Eve is
[1539.84] not in the Quran either Adam and Eve so
[1542.08] since Eve is not in the Quran I cannot
[1543.68] attain salvation where are we setting
[1545.60] these criterias okay who gave you the
[1547.60] Quran let's begin with
[1550.64] that so you're going to make Muslim
[1552.76] arguments now no who gave you the Quran
[1556.28] how the Quran that you have you have a
[1558.04] qur
[1558.80] in your house right who gave that the
[1560.60] Quran to you yes where does it come
[1562.52] Froman yeah the Quran was dictated to
[1565.92] Prophet Muhammad wrote it down copied by
[1568.44] scribes distributed in the lands and
[1571.36] preserved by God generation after
[1573.72] generation and we have it today okay so
[1576.40] you have the Quran from people right
[1579.08] from people who are these people who
[1581.64] gave you the Quran can you give me the
[1584.16] names no doesn't matter so it doesn't
[1587.80] the
[1588.76] see see un you see how he stuck again
[1590.60] guys you see you are stuck again you
[1593.28] stuck I'm not stuck I'm not stuck let me
[1595.64] answer okay unlike the Hadith the Quan
[1597.92] does not require chains of transmission
[1600.00] so we don't need names of people it's so
[1603.40] it's the most remembered recited and
[1606.24] recorded book in all of human history so
[1609.08] the Quran doesn't need any any isad no
[1611.96] no chain of narration no can you open
[1615.12] the Arabic Quran for me don't use don't
[1617.20] use an English translation give me the
[1619.48] the very first Pages or maybe it's
[1621.24] sometimes in the last part of the
[1623.80] Quran I challenge you to show me if it
[1626.56] doesn't have an isnad go ahead because
[1629.48] it h it has no no I said we don't need
[1633.32] an isnad but it has an isnad you said
[1636.80] someone can claim someone can claim an
[1638.60] isnad but we don't need an isnad thean
[1641.68] stand what Quran do you use I have the
[1644.84] Quran the prophet Muhammad received
[1646.84] which one is that it has a
[1649.48] name mine does not have a name what what
[1652.80] can you can you show me the
[1654.64] cover the closest one the closest one
[1658.16] would be H and aam okay so H you have
[1661.44] the H Quran right
[1664.08] well the closest no I said the closest
[1667.56] to that the
[1669.32] clan I don't care I don't care about
[1671.40] that what is the Quran that you use what
[1673.48] is the Quran that you
[1674.84] use the same one that Prophet the same
[1677.80] Quran the prophet Muhammad had okay um
[1680.20] do you what do you think about Rashad
[1682.80] khif he was a messenger of God uh so
[1685.64] you're Rashad Khalifa why don't you why
[1687.80] don't you say it from the start that you
[1690.60] Khalifa I put it in the chat did you ask
[1693.32] me oh so you okay so here's a question
[1697.80] can you go foro yeah can you go for me
[1700.32] to chapter 9 ay 128 and 129 please no
[1704.48] because they don't exist ah you see
[1707.40] can't why yeah there's vers yeah God
[1710.08] says he's going to protect the Quran and
[1711.64] he did why should I recite I I have a
[1715.12] Quran here that does not end at at
[1718.28] chapter 9 ay 178 17 27 yours does yeah
[1723.68] yeah here my Quran here that I have on
[1725.92] the screen my Quran ends at 129 in
[1729.56] chapter 9 yours is stops at 127 right
[1733.24] the burden of the burden of proof is on
[1734.88] you to prove those real verses from God
[1736.84] and not from Satan aha so so wait Satan
[1740.16] intervened and he put ay in the Quran he
[1743.12] attempted to yes but of course his plot
[1745.80] is always overturned his plot is always
[1748.44] overturned Satan schemes but God is the
[1750.88] best schemer a so Allah is the best
[1754.08] deceiver
[1755.40] right best schemer a best deceiver ma
[1758.96] deceiver okay so so wait wait so so are
[1761.76] you saying are saying that much later
[1763.80] Muslims or Muslim scribes Allah allowed
[1766.72] Muslim scribes to put teic verses in
[1768.92] chapter 9 and specifically the last two
[1771.84] ay if you read the beginning of chapter
[1774.92] 74 which is about the hidden secret and
[1777.40] the preservation system of the Quran God
[1780.40] says to the hidden secret come out and
[1783.16] warn purify your garment forsake what is
[1786.04] wrong the Garment of the code is the
[1788.04] Quran the Garment was cleansed the Musa
[1790.32] is on Earth God preserves the Quran in
[1792.84] the with the preservation system we are
[1796.04] able to determine the original Quran the
[1798.04] Prophet Muhammad received not the 28
[1799.84] versions that exist today okay prove to
[1801.48] me prove to me that chapter n your
[1804.12] chapter n is the real chapter that other
[1807.60] Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims don't
[1810.40] what they have in their possession is
[1811.60] corrupted yeah what's hilarious is the
[1814.00] Sunni Muslims Hadith themselves already
[1815.60] rejects these two verses so these two
[1817.96] verses are not even M according to their
[1820.24] own standards okay that just just on
[1822.88] historical basis where do you where do
[1824.24] you where where do you come with this
[1825.64] idea where it's called an internal
[1828.04] critique Eternal critique means using
[1830.36] their own sources to refute them that
[1832.88] that would be from bukari and others
[1834.44] just to summarize people in the chat
[1836.28] listen carefully according to this
[1838.28] gentleman here on the call Navid that's
[1840.76] his name he says that the Quran of today
[1844.68] right the H and specifically the H Quran
[1847.48] all actually all of
[1848.88] them all all of these different Arabic
[1852.08] Quran the qurans that have chapter 9 128
[1856.12] and 129 in it those are corrupted qurans
[1860.04] they these ay are demonic they are
[1862.60] satanic yes naid has a uh a new Quran
[1867.56] that was created by Rashad Khalifa in
[1869.92] the '90s and that same Rashad Khalifa
[1873.28] who was supposedly the final messenger
[1876.24] the salfi Muslims they went inside the
[1878.52] MOs tuon and they stabbed him in his
[1881.32] heart to death they literally Sunni
[1883.64] Muslims went inside the mosque of rashed
[1885.76] Khalifa and they put a knife in his back
[1889.80] right they they they analy them and and
[1892.56] later people like that famous bil Bel
[1896.04] Phillips Imam bil Phillips in Canada
[1898.00] even saluted the analer the murderer of
[1901.40] Rashad Khalifa that's some side
[1903.68] information for but again brother so
[1906.20] you're saying just to understand you
[1907.80] correctly just a respond some of this
[1910.52] yeah just a second so just to summarize
[1912.80] just you know just to conclude according
[1914.84] to you what the sunnis in have in their
[1917.36] possession
[1918.56] and specifically chapter 9 ay 1 128 and
[1921.48] 129 is demonic it's satanic right these
[1923.68] two a here yeah I mean calling calling
[1927.24] the prophet a name of God is
[1928.60] automatically demonic and
[1930.64] specifically right they're calling yes
[1933.12] yes that's a name of God it's used eight
[1934.88] times in the Quran every time it's used
[1936.92] for God so I don't know what they were
[1938.60] thinking they thought they can get away
[1940.24] with this but we don't need any of
[1942.56] this the the merciful cannot be Muhammad
[1946.20] that's what you're saying this is no no
[1947.48] no can't no no no the name this is a
[1949.84] name with the double attribute
[1953.64] adjective in the Quran this is only used
[1956.16] for God eight times but I want to
[1957.92] correct just a few things you said but
[1959.28] before that I want to thank you for
[1960.64] having a respectful calm discussion I
[1962.36] appreciate this civil discourse even if
[1964.24] we disagree I'm not here to fight
[1965.84] anybody brother just you know so so code
[1969.88] 19 is a mathematical system that
[1972.00] preserves the
[1973.08] Quran it detect this is an antivirus
[1976.40] system it detect virus is yes yes it's
[1980.88] ECC air correction code did a full body
[1984.04] scan of the Quran these two verses stuck
[1986.20] out there's 26 words here nine of them
[1989.20] disrupt The Code by one each what's the
[1991.28] odds of that one in 11
[1993.56] billion brother brother I understand I
[1996.60] understand you know I know I know all
[1998.36] about the miracle uh number 19 but here
[2001.16] we have a problem the Arabic does not
[2003.68] the Arabic doesn't help you the Arabic
[2006.16] the Quran doesn't help you why not
[2008.76] because there's nothing called B it's B
[2011.76] that's one and there's nothing called it
[2014.44] should
[2015.96] be what are you going to do with these
[2018.24] grammar mistakes spelling mistakes so
[2021.28] you're changing the topic now I talking
[2023.52] versus because you're using the miracle
[2025.60] number 19 but there's nothing called B
[2028.80] this is literally uh a wrong spelling it
[2031.76] should be B
[2033.56] ISM brother that's your conjecture
[2036.20] that's your con no no why why according
[2038.68] to you why what do you mean conjecture
[2041.00] what do you mean that that's your
[2042.60] conjecture that that's not a word I mean
[2044.32] what do you want to you want address
[2046.40] it's
[2047.40] BM yeah so the the the Quran gives
[2050.04] examples of both right so if you go to
[2053.00] 961 is B yeah both both terms are used
[2057.28] in the Quran if you go to 961 it's B is
[2060.88] with the AL but there in the F simply
[2065.36] here B ism is the correct and this wrong
[2067.76] wrong one and what about if I remove the
[2070.88] vows it becomes a brother you're
[2075.28] just yeah yeah now you're doing a gram
[2078.92] what about the other reading Mal orik
[2082.16] and what about Mal yeah we what about
[2085.04] and what about diverting no no I'm not
[2086.88] diverting I'm I'm showing you that you
[2088.20] have a a problem with your number 19
[2090.20] it's it does not add
[2092.00] up just just text just a second also for
[2097.92] a number
[2099.24] seven om the companion of Muhammad used
[2102.84] to read it differently it he used to
[2104.52] read it as I don't believe in just
[2107.24] second I don't believe in so you're you
[2109.68] which what Rashad khif what your Rashad
[2111.96] Khalifa your messenger your messenger
[2114.60] khif what he did he chose the H version
[2117.80] and for some reason he liked it or
[2119.92] something and he rejected the word she
[2122.04] rejected all the Au clear wait a second
[2125.44] Omar Omar used to read Omar the K of
[2129.12] the read no no no no no what fake
[2132.72] history because yeah so who let me
[2136.16] finish my sentence brother you said
[2138.64] you're not here to fight me right so
[2141.28] you're you're not letting me address
[2142.80] anything you just made 15 you are
[2145.64] allowed to address just a
[2147.24] second used to read this
[2149.76] Ayah number seven he used to read it as
[2160.40] so why did uhif choose the reading in
[2163.88] this case and not only did he choose the
[2166.04] house reading but he corrupted chapter
[2167.88] nine as well okay so can I address all
[2170.88] this go ahead because you bring in a lot
[2172.64] of points like I I appreciate your
[2174.12] passion and I appreciate the inquiry but
[2176.24] we need a chance to address these uh
[2180.20] issues in
[2182.24] 1924 uh they had a conference they
[2184.76] standardized the Cairo edition of the
[2188.08] Quran that's the one that Rashad used
[2190.36] this was the most so it only makes sense
[2192.84] for him to go off of the most popular
[2195.08] edition of the Quran standardized in the
[2197.08] world that became H and awesome with
[2199.16] over
[2200.36] 95.6% usage in the world so he used that
[2204.04] and that ironically by God's Perfect
[2207.40] Design and plan had the most cooperation
[2210.56] with the mathematical structure based on
[2212.04] the number 19 then a further analysis
[2214.84] detected any discrepancies there but God
[2218.00] says he's protecting the Quran in the L
[2220.32] ma the master tablet 8521 and 22 okay
[2224.56] the way we can reach the master tablet
[2226.92] is with the ECC air correction code and
[2229.24] that's only achieved with the ultimate
[2230.56] Miracle code9 this is God's preservation
[2233.08] system right there is no other
[2235.04] preservation system to this degree of
[2237.48] accuracy and
[2238.76] pinpoint information beautiful okay let
[2242.28] us go back toah F since we're talking
[2245.16] about Surah faat anyway who's talking
[2247.36] that
[2248.24] here we are talking to God this is a
[2250.68] prescription for us to use during our
[2252.52] daily contact prayers five times a day
[2254.40] whose words are these these are our
[2256.88] words towards
[2259.00] God speak so your words are in the
[2262.64] Quran God is giving us a formula to use
[2265.80] to utilize connection with him yes but
[2267.60] whose words are these are the so you
[2269.28] lived you lived in the seventh century
[2271.88] No he gave us a prescription for us to
[2275.04] show me where it says
[2277.56] it doesn't need to say that's what I'm
[2279.20] saying it does because in other chapters
[2281.28] start
[2284.32] with say but here if you say these are
[2287.36] the words of Allah or Allah is
[2289.80] commanding you to say that then Allah
[2291.48] should have said say no no no he wrote a
[2295.08] prescription for us to use what do you
[2296.96] mean no he wrote a prescription he wrote
[2298.72] a prescription for us to use okay show
[2300.52] us how he wrote it show show that Allah
[2302.88] saying say say oh wait a second brother
[2306.36] brother brother don't don't teach me
[2308.56] about the Quran brother I I know Quran
[2310.80] better than you and I can teach you
[2312.08] about the Quran so don't go there don't
[2313.56] play those games with me my question is
[2315.80] simple in other chapters when Allah
[2318.00] whenever Allah wants to to say something
[2320.08] to to let's say to Muhammad or the
[2321.88] companions he always starts with say say
[2326.00] so where is Allah commanding you to
[2328.00] repeat after
[2329.76] him say in the name of
[2332.88] Allah say
[2335.48] alhamdulillah say
[2338.16] so where where where is the word say
[2340.20] yeah yeah it's very simple there's two
[2341.84] billion Muslims all of them understand
[2343.48] that this is what they're supposed to
[2344.44] use in their Sal so with all the respect
[2348.20] with all du respect all you Muslims have
[2349.84] a problem that you can't fix this is
[2351.40] what we call a major dilemma now you
[2353.64] know what's fascinating about this just
[2355.16] to add to the fact that this is a
[2357.64] formula from God how many times does
[2359.88] your lips touch when you recite this
[2361.16] chapter do you
[2363.64] know I'm asking you where's the word say
[2367.16] yeah it doesn't need commands you to say
[2369.68] something should let me show you
[2370.80] something okay you didn't like my
[2372.40] question I'll just answer it myself yeah
[2374.00] you see 19 times your lips touch this is
[2377.44] the formula from God this is the chapter
[2379.44] we recite to make our direct connection
[2381.44] with our creator five times a day 17
[2383.72] times we recite this how many by way how
[2385.72] many Muslims how many
[2387.28] Muslims 19 times a day our lips touch
[2390.64] when we recite the you gave me a number
[2392.40] of Muslims on this plan how how how big
[2394.28] is that number billion billion so so
[2397.64] wait the Sunni Muslims are now Muslims
[2399.44] according to you the Shia are Muslims

[2807.96] Muslim by the way that Miracle number 19
[2810.56] guys is literally is a disaster for the
[2813.64] rash khif Muslims who claim to be
[2815.80] Muslims because what are you going to do
[2818.44] with these letters they are counting you
[2820.40] see this dagger El guys if I make it
[2822.48] bigger you see this dagger El here on

[2827.96] the on top of the letter M or beside the
[2832.16] letter M it's not a
[2834.68] letter it does not exist this this is
[2837.24] literally added many years
[2839.32] later right when the Arabic texts
[2842.20] started to be changed by people like uh
[2845.28] Abu
[2847.12] Al and likef when they introduced this
[2851.16] new style of Arabic Because the skeleton
[2854.20] text does not have this dger Al so you
[2857.08] have to read it
[2859.16] asman and there's nothing called be B
[2862.80] it's B ISM this is another misspelling
[2866.08] mistake right Rob why did you
[2871.28] lie brother why did you lie wait I what
[2874.28] kind of Muslim are you
[2875.68] brother I'm I'm not a Muslim I'm a
[2877.96] submitter but you lie you're a what
[2880.88] submitter
[2883.08] submitter it's a Kiran only sect of
[2885.60] Islam so

[3050.84] prophets and Messengers they claim that
[3052.84] they are the real submitters Muslims you
[3055.20] are not a real Muslim what do you want
[3057.44] to say to them and they claimed also
[3059.20] that chapter 9 Ayah 128 and 29 are
[3062.24] demonic from Satan what do you think
[3064.48] what do you want to say to
[3066.28] them um I Would by the way he called you
[3068.64] a mush as well he called you a mush as
[3072.64] well yeah I would have to say to them
[3075.24] that um there's a lot of evidence that
[3078.60] the Sunnah is from God and it is correct
[3081.16] and that we should follow it and I pray
[3083.92] that they are forgiven for the Deviant
[3086.36] but they called you a
[3089.12] mush yeah I ask God to forgive them for
[3092.52] that ignorance flame because it's not
[3096.36] true and uh according to to the Sharia
[3100.00] of Allah if Shar would have been
[3101.44] implanted what would happen to these
[3103.04] so-called Muslims brother who claim that
[3105.28] the Quran of Allah is corrupted and
[3107.28] there are passages that are demonic and
[3109.32] specifically in chapter 9 I 128 and 29
[3113.08] what what would happen to
[3114.88] them if God
[3117.04] true if if God's true judgment would be
[3119.36] on earth um they would they would just
[3122.24] be looked at as deviant and what will
[3124.80] happen to them what is the final step if
[3127.24] they don't
[3129.32] repent
[3131.56] nothing so when they when they when they
[3134.32] say that the Shada is and when they say
[3137.32] that the Quran is corrupted and they
[3138.72] call you
[3140.20] mus nothing will happen to
[3143.44] them no I wouldn't do anything to them
[3146.00] no no not you what will happen under a
[3148.16] true caliphate a true Shar caliphate
[3151.16] implemented I would say I'm I would say
[3153.56] I'm more true than anything that differs
[3156.24] from my opinion what did the prophet say
[3158.28] about people who who who uh let's say
[3162.20] let's say uh I like them somebody who
[3165.68] changes religion from let's say Sunni to
[3169.00] Quran only what will happen to
[3170.88] them if you would change the religion
[3173.36] from a Muslim from a submitter to
[3175.28] anything else uh you would be killed
[3178.80] based on the apostasy law now I don't
[3181.00] consider they would be so they would be
[3183.40] so they would be un alived right don't
[3185.48] use the k word please they would be un
[3187.28] alived
[3188.44] right yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't do that
[3191.44] because I don't think there are I'm not
[3192.84] talking about you I'm talking about
[3194.64] under Shar rule they would be anal lived
[3199.24] right under some interpretations which
[3202.24] are wrong there would be uh or maybe
[3205.28] likely wrong yeah there would said
[3208.24] anybody who changes his religion should
[3209.76] be unived Muhammad was wrong no he's
[3212.72] absolutely right but I wouldn't say that
[3214.48] change their religion I just say they
[3216.36] deviated from the true path so they
[3219.32] should be unived right no okay so
[3222.84] Muhammad when muhammmad said anybody who
[3225.12] changes religion he should be un alived
[3227.32] he was
[3228.24] wrong no he was right and I would say
[3230.92] the Quran only people didn't change
[3233.12] their religion they are still submitters
[3235.04] but they are just uh
[3237.52] okay if they say that the shahada
[3241.36] is sh are they still
[3245.88] Muslims did they change their
[3251.04] religion yes they're still ex it is
[3254.48] brother please you see you're talking to
[3256.16] Rob Christian and I'm very very very
[3258.36] very immune for lies that's true so the
[3261.96] the answer is yes they are going to be
[3264.52] anal lived if they don't repent Within
[3266.56] days they should be analyed because
[3269.56] according to that statement they are not
[3272.88] Muslims anymore they don't accept your
[3275.80] Quran the Quran that you have in your
[3277.60] house they don't accept it they say that
[3278.96] it's corrupted and it contain demonic
[3281.60] ayas from Satan and they claim that it's
[3284.64] your Quran is corrupted and on top of
[3287.16] that they claim that your shahada is so
[3290.72] are you and they are you and they follow
[3292.84] the same religion the answer is no right
[3296.68] let me okay let me analyze okay so
[3299.48] there's two principles so the first
[3301.04] principle is the five pillars of Islam
[3303.80] the five pillars of the religion itself
[3306.04] that is to confirm that there is nobody
[3308.20] worthy of worship except God and
[3310.16] Muhammad is his messenger do they
[3311.60] believe in that yes they believe in that
[3313.20] so no they don't they do believe
[3317.60] and they don't they don't because they
[3319.96] said it's
[3321.72] sh no no they may be saying that the
[3325.36] statement is this dis belief but they're
[3327.04] still confirming it they're still
[3328.68] believing it no because they say that
[3331.08] Muhammad is the not last messenger it's
[3334.00] Rashad Khalifa do you believe that what
[3336.20] what they say about Rashad Khalifa who
[3338.24] was stabbed in the 90s by Sunni salafi
[3340.68] Muslims like you do you accept that he's
[3343.04] the final
[3344.68] messenger no not at all he was a are
[3347.24] they Muslim are they are they then
[3348.96] Muslims in the in your eyes are they
[3351.32] Muslims if they follow a false prophet
[3354.68] knowingly um
[3357.08] no longer no but so punishment should be
[3360.84] applied on them
[3362.32] right yeah there should thank you
[3364.72] finally
[3366.32] hey thank you finally okay I'm so happy
[3369.68] that you're on uh on the panel brother
[3371.72] because I still did not even start my uh
[3374.24] my topic for today what do you think
[3376.28] about a man who lust after married
[3379.84] woman and I'm talking about Muslim
[3381.88] married
[3384.88] woman a a my man who L over a married
[3388.24] woman that's a sin to It's a Sin it's a
[3393.40] sin are you
[3395.76] sure yeah I'm pretty sure can you read
[3399.20] for me chapter 33 I
[3402.84] 50 no can you do it because my phone is
[3405.68] pretty slow and I cannot pull up
[3407.32] anything so okay it's a very long
[3410.64] ey chapter 33 I 50 do you see it on the
[3414.68] screen yeah I do okay if we scroll down
[3418.36] it's a very long Ayah it says the
[3421.16] following and
[3423.20] any and the believing woman any
[3425.92] believing woman who gives herself to
[3428.28] Muhammad and whom he wants to take in
[3430.84] marriage this is a privilege only for
[3434.40] Muhammad
[3436.16] mhm it's not for the rest of the Muslims
[3439.52] so if a married Muslim woman comes to
[3441.68] Muhammad and she gives herself to
[3443.80] Muhammad she's still married
[3448.20] would that be Halal for
[3450.20] Muhammad yes her marriage would be
[3452.88] invalidated and she would be
[3454.52] automatically a married to the prophet
[3456.92] but you said it's it's not okay in the
[3458.56] beginning you said it's not it's Haram
[3460.20] to do that it's it's not allowed yeah
[3462.80] but why is Muhammad getting so so try to
[3466.92] you know I want to understand his logic
[3469.52] why or why did Muhammad give himself
[3471.64] privileges claiming that it's divine
[3473.20] revelation from Allah that that only he
[3475.80] has no other man has no that is God
[3479.48] giving him the privilege and that is God
[3481.44] honoring him in a in a very befitting
[3483.60] manner let me rephrase my question then
[3486.72] I'm happy that you said that beautiful
[3489.12] so if muham EMP okay if if you and your
[3492.76] Prophet would have lived in the seventh
[3494.08] century together you let's say you're a
[3496.76] companion of Muhammad
[3499.24] Muhammad sees you and he sees your wife
[3502.36] together you're walking let's say on the
[3504.12] streets of Medina and your prophet
[3506.12] prophet's eyes lay on your wife your be
[3509.84] maybe you have a beautiful wife she's a
[3511.88] beautiful mother of let's say three of
[3514.48] your
[3515.48] children and your Prophet lays his eyes
[3517.96] on your wife listen carefully the love
[3520.12] of your wife of your life your own wife
[3522.60] the mother of your children and he
[3524.64] starts to lust for her he he his heart
[3527.48] is starting to beat out of his chest for
[3529.56] your wife are you saying that you are
[3532.72] willing to give her to Muhammad so that
[3535.12] Muhammad can have
[3536.56] intercourse with your
[3538.28] wife the sad reality is yes I would have
[3541.24] to sacrifice myself and my own wife and
[3543.96] children for the prophet yeah s reality
[3547.60] fleshly in a fleshly sense sad reality
[3550.16] in a spiritual sense it's it is not a
[3552.40] sad reality because I would just have to
[3554.24] submit and be good with it wow so so
[3557.12] it's a sad reality that you have
[3563.60] to so you you are willing to become a
[3567.72] cockold for
[3570.04] Muhammad um that is a very far stretched
[3574.08] uh statement because what is the
[3575.72] definition of Co what is the definition
[3579.40] then you give it to your Prophet I have
[3581.04] no idea about that you don't know what
[3583.20] cockle
[3587.48] means you have to according to this a
[3590.84] you have to become a
[3593.20] cuckold now as it said you're fleshly
[3596.04] you're fleshly you are still against
[3600.04] it but your Allah made you a
[3608.92] cockold you know that your wife is going
[3611.44] to sleep with Muhammad and you're okay
[3612.92] with it I had a debate with a Muslim
[3615.44] like you once and he said I'm even
[3617.32] willing to open the legs of my wife for
[3621.72] Muhammad that sounds like uh extreme
[3625.52] self sacrifice if if you if you willing
[3628.72] to divorce your wife for the prophet and
[3632.24] God ordered it and so it is what it is
[3634.52] you're no longer with that wife so
[3636.40] you're already broken the chain with
[3638.64] your wife it's no longer yours and thus
[3640.60] you're not a uh you don't you don't have
[3643.40] a weak um sort of uh um state right it's
[3649.24] no longer to become a self sacrifice
[3652.44] brotherly yeah so you are willing you
[3654.88] are willingly
[3657.08] going to make yourself a
[3658.88] self-sacrifice and you're going to
[3660.52] sacrifice the mother of your children
[3662.76] just let me finish brother yeah you are
[3665.16] going to sacrifice your wife that you
[3667.12] supposedly love dearly you had let's say
[3669.80] three or four children with her to to
[3673.28] sacrifice her vagina for
[3676.76] Muhammad 1,00% I would sacrifice myself
[3679.88] and my family for the profit a th% that
[3683.40] is actually what is required from
[3685.92] Believers of the highest grade actually
[3688.76] unbelievable you hear it guys he's going
[3690.84] to sacrifice the vagina of his wife for
[3696.12] Muhammad I take this as an insult uh
[3699.20] it's not an insult because you you're
[3700.80] just openly admitted yeah but you're
[3703.04] being explicit and that is not but we
[3705.88] have to be explicit because you are
[3708.20] literally giving away the vagina of your
[3712.16] wife you forcing your wife appreciate
[3716.04] yeah why why do you have to go into
[3718.08] explicit things in the reality I want
[3721.00] everybody to clip this finally you have
[3722.64] an
[3723.72] honest yeah finally we have an honest
[3725.96] Muslim who says he's willingly to he's
[3728.16] willingly to become an cockold a cook
[3730.92] for Muhammad his
[3732.76] penis okay thank you so you're okay that
[3737.52] Muhammad sto other question yeah you're
[3739.72] okay that Muhammad stole people's wives
[3742.68] claiming that it's divine revelation
[3744.12] from Allah you okay with that
[3746.72] I'm okay with God giving the prophet
[3749.08] wives of people or th% okay so you're
[3753.24] okay with the tap because I've seen many
[3755.92] Muslims who say Rob you're lying but the
[3758.56] tap of Al in chapter 17 where it
[3762.28] says that Muhammad had a privilege
[3764.80] privilege number 10 on page
[3767.60] 187 same chapter same a chapter 33y 50
[3771.64] where it says that Muhammad has a
[3773.32] privilege that no other man has and for
[3777.12] the example of Zade is the adopted son
[3779.44] of
[3781.04] Muhammad you okay I totally agree with
[3783.48] that absolutely okay guys do you hear it
[3786.28] I'm so happy I'm so happy he just
[3788.36] actually did my work for me because I
[3790.88] had a long life show ahead of me so
[3793.08] thank you for admitting that you're okay
[3795.48] with what your Scholars explained about
[3797.28] your Prophet that any married Muslim
[3799.12] woman if Muhammad desires her fleshly
[3802.68] carnal desires for a married Muslim
[3805.12] woman then her husband is forced to
[3807.12] divorce her and hand her over to
[3808.96] Muhammad so that the prophet can have
[3811.20] intercourse with her and you see here it
[3814.08] says on the screen said this is what the
[3817.00] servant of the two holy mosqu has also
[3819.08] said as was clear to the scholars from
[3821.80] the story of ZB
[3823.92] Muhammad which also had this meaning now
[3826.52] I have another
[3828.64] question because of what happened here
[3831.40] in the in the historical context of
[3833.40] chapter 33 i5
[3835.92] Muhammad because of his lust now
[3838.96] adoption is not Halal anymore adoption
[3842.92] became unlawful so let's say you are
[3846.72] married your wife or maybe you you have
[3849.52] bad seed or your wife biologically
[3852.96] cannot become pregnant of you or maybe
[3855.60] have bad seed you can't make your wife
[3857.48] pregnant because of the lustful story of
[3860.24] Muhammad with Z bash his
[3863.60] daughter-in-law now you Muslims can not
[3865.96] adopt children you okay with that you
[3869.52] honestly you okay with that I don't know
[3871.76] if it's because of that um I'm pretty
[3874.80] unsure if it's because of that but uh of
[3877.72] course it is because in the same
[3879.96] chapter chap it says whatever you are
[3882.60] not allowed to adopt children anymore
[3885.28] brother listen yeah so what you whatever
[3889.12] law God comes up with I have to be okay
[3891.24] with so so you're saying you're okay
[3894.16] that
[3895.88] MH you're okay that children poor orphan
[3899.28] children cannot be adopted because of
[3902.24] this you adoption became nullified not
[3906.20] allowed to
[3908.56] adopt children who needs actually par or
[3911.44] parents who wants to become parents
[3913.24] because they cannot become pregnant
[3915.12] anymore they cannot adopt children
[3917.72] because of the lust of Muhammad and you
[3919.44] okay with that these poor children that
[3921.80] cannot be adopted anymore and can be
[3923.72] taken care of by by by who wants to
[3926.40] become parents only because of the of
[3929.20] Muhammad not sure if it's because of
[3931.76] that not sure if it's because of that if
[3934.32] it was it's in the same chapter brother
[3935.96] do you want me to show you relatively
[3938.44] irrelevant because um you can still
[3940.92] adopt a child meaning you can take care
[3942.80] of it take it as a f adoption is
[3945.04] nullified you know that yeah you can
[3947.28] raise it up but you should not like give
[3949.52] it a name like you should not it should
[3951.72] not take your name but you can foster it
[3953.36] I think if I'm not mistaken adoption is
[3956.72] Haram in Islam brother adoption adoption
[3960.48] meaning you you completely adopted you
[3962.96] you it has the same inheritance laws and
[3965.36] stuff like that yeah but taking it as a
[3967.44] foster child I don't think that's
[3969.48] forbidden so so so you're so you're not
[3972.04] so you're okay with not adopting
[3973.96] children anymore uh giving them your
[3976.92] last name and they can inherit you're
[3979.48] you're C only for the loss of Muhammad
[3982.12] right not I wouldn't say for that I mean
[3985.08] there needs to proven evidence that's
[3986.76] because of him but uh even if that was
[3989.24] the case I believe God has the authority
[3992.16] to legislate his laws and I think that's
[3994.56] okay okay so because of Muhammad's penis
[3997.76] to be specific because of Muhammad's
[3999.88] penis you cannot adopt children in Islam
[4006.60] anymore
[4008.16] right because of Muhammad lasting after
[4011.96] Z jash when he you know the story one
[4014.72] day he goes to the house of his son
[4018.24] right to the house of his
[4022.28] son and instead of uh his son he sees
[4026.60] Zab his
[4029.36] daughter-in-law
[4031.84] yeah
[4033.88] MH what kind of father lost
[4038.68] after the wife of his
[4042.24] son fleshly desires exist okay fleshly
[4046.36] desires exist and you call him a prophet
[4048.00] of
[4049.04] God of course every Prophet is made in
[4051.92] fleshly desires and so every Prophet
[4054.16] will experience fleshly desires so did
[4056.16] Solomon so did David and they all did
[4058.76] bad stuff but after all God said David
[4061.76] is a righteous man after the heart of
[4063.32] God so uh David did kill his neighbor
[4066.80] his neighbor to get his wife but yet God
[4068.96] still called them righteous at the end
[4070.44] of the day so yeah FLH desire Su okay
[4073.16] you see here you are very dishonest
[4074.88] homos you what can we expect because I
[4078.40] have a question did God the Bible did
[4082.00] God punish David did God punish
[4085.80] Solomon yes for sure did he punish David
[4089.24] did
[4091.08] Allah did Allah then punish did Allah
[4094.68] yes the answer is yes did Allah then
[4097.12] punish David again listen carefully did
[4099.56] Allah then punish Muhammad for what he
[4101.92] did no he didn't but did God punish
[4105.16] David yes he punished David and he
[4107.32] punished Solomon yes yes but your Allah
[4110.96] condoned it and he said go go ahead do
[4113.88] it why do you why do you reject what I
[4118.00] made Allah Hal for you why are you
[4120.96] ashamed of the people you see you see
[4123.72] the hypocrisy you see the hypocrisy
[4125.40] brother no because Muhammad didn't kill
[4128.00] him and the what the wife still belongs
[4130.40] to God and God can give that woman to
[4132.72] wherever he wanted it looks like it was
[4134.92] predestined sign that that woman belongs
[4136.72] to the prophet and the prophet only saw
[4138.48] in that regards because he saw his
[4140.60] Destiny there had to unive him don't use
[4143.32] the k word I warned you please do not
[4145.60] use the k
[4146.80] word okay so you so only the unal living
[4151.08] that would be the the the the only sin
[4153.20] so stealing his wife lasting after his
[4155.64] wife was not a sin but if if we he would
[4158.40] have unived him that would be the sin
[4160.16] that's that's the only
[4162.08] sin no it's also a sin it's also a sin
[4165.48] ah so Muhammad did Sin when he losted
[4167.36] after his uh adopted son's wife God made
[4171.16] that gave him a special privilege so
[4173.52] it's no longer a sin uhhuh so you you
[4176.76] don't see the problem you don't see the
[4178.60] the hypocrisy coming from your uh end
[4181.60] god of the Bible no he says in in the
[4183.88] Ten Commandments do not L after
[4186.72] somebody's wife Allah who is not the
[4189.52] same God and we have to admit that now
[4191.76] you have to admit it Allah who's who is
[4194.48] Satan in this guys he Condon said
[4197.36] Muhammad why are you ashamed of the
[4199.04] people go ahead sleep with your adopted
[4201.16] uh wife's uh adopted son's wife Z no I
[4205.68] have no idea did he dream about her did
[4208.28] he have like if he dreamed about her
[4210.44] honestly it was was God's will but
[4212.36] here's the problem you're missing
[4213.60] something brother you're missing
[4214.56] something did he dream about her by the
[4216.56] way wait a second wait a second read for
[4218.56] me chapter 33 I 36 let's start from
[4221.60] there yeah um just to clarify so if he
[4224.84] dreamed read for me what says here on
[4226.96] the screen then God God inspired him to
[4229.32] do so so it's different from David just
[4231.84] a second so you I I know that you are uh
[4235.72] spiritually blind you don't see that uh
[4237.80] God punished the prophets in the Old
[4240.24] Testament but Allah never punished
[4242.04] Muhammad and he said actually go ahead
[4243.56] but let us read let us read brother let
[4245.96] us read let us read let us read are you
[4248.48] going to read so God promise are you
[4250.08] going to listen are you going to listen
[4251.64] it is not are you going to listen are
[4254.04] you going to listen yeah read chapter 33
[4256.92] 36 for
[4260.44] me 36 okay it is not for believing man
[4264.80] or a believing woman when God and His
[4266.92] messenger have decided a matter that it
[4270.20] should have any choice about
[4274.00] it about the I cannot read that uh their
[4278.64] Affair their Affair whoever disobeys God
[4281.52] and His messenger has certainly strayed
[4284.24] into
[4286.28] what what clear eror clear eror okay
[4290.08] what does it mean what is the what is me
[4293.36] God or his Prophet decides something uh
[4296.60] that a man cannot disagree with it okay
[4299.84] what is that something here in context
[4301.80] what did how did the scholars interpret
[4303.76] this
[4305.52] Ayah I have no idea it's just plain
[4308.64] simply means exactly what I just said
[4311.56] give me give me what you think uh what
[4314.08] this possibly could have meant
[4316.44] it means exactly what I said it means
[4318.24] that if God and His messenger decree
[4320.00] something there you cannot come along
[4321.64] and say well I don't agree with that and
[4324.40] what do you think is this is
[4326.56] about have you studied histal looks like
[4330.76] yeah looks like it is about the incident
[4332.68] where uh he maybe dreamed about the
[4334.80] woman that he was promised by God and
[4336.52] then he went and said hey no if you
[4339.20] don't know then don't you know because
[4341.28] you know in Islam is very dangerous if
[4342.76] you misquote the Quran you know be
[4344.60] careful brother just for your sake I
[4346.60] made an assumption okay do not make an
[4348.84] assumption brother assumption is the
[4350.92] mother of all pops don't do that too
[4354.56] much assumption but um so let's go to
[4356.88] the historical reason behind working out
[4359.56] word here yeah there's something called
[4361.44] as have you ever heard of it as reason
[4364.80] why an i down okay so let us go today
[4367.44] let us not do assumption because
[4368.76] assumption is very dangerous in Islam it
[4370.60] can cost cost you dearly no so don't
[4373.84] make mistake
[4375.80] no because we're figuring out the truth
[4377.64] right you're not a scholar I'm not a
[4379.36] scholar right yeah but we are people who
[4382.24] are seeking out truth okay let's see
[4384.60] what the truth behind it is the truth is
[4387.08] very simple if you go to and let's see
[4390.28] the specific stuff okay if we go to the
[4393.36] of Al for the same chapter same ay
[4397.16] look and narrated the reason for the
[4399.88] revelation of this verse that we just
[4401.76] read chapter 33 36 the messenger of be Z
[4406.84] bash who was his A's daughter so in
[4410.36] other words she was his cousin and she
[4412.96] thought that the engagement was for
[4415.48] himself so what happens is when Muhammad
[4418.52] came to ask for the hand of
[4420.92] zanab she thought she Zab thought that
[4425.80] Muhammad would come to marry her but she
[4428.56] didn't realized that it was for his
[4430.64] adopted son Zade and she likes she
[4433.84] disliked and refused so the verse was
[4437.84] revealed so the first step is so we're
[4441.20] starting all the way from a we started
[4443.72] from Z we're now starting from a we we
[4445.72] are going back to the very Beginnings so
[4449.12] what's going on is Muhammad comes to the
[4452.36] house of zanab and he wants to get
[4457.20] married not him he wants to marry Zade
[4461.48] his adopted son to her and she didn't
[4464.00] like it because um what she what she's
[4466.04] going to do with an adopted son who was
[4467.92] originally a
[4469.36] slave why slave because uh Khadijah
[4473.88] adopted
[4475.00] him and uh at that time it he was called
[4479.52] Zade Muhammad Zade the son of
[4483.00] Muhammad after nullifying the adoption
[4486.40] in Islam he to he had he was forced to
[4489.88] take his original name ZB are you still
[4493.28] following Brother
[4495.44] yeah I'm following okay so here Muhammad
[4498.68] is forcing zanab to marry his adopted
[4501.16] son Zade IB Muhammad at this
[4505.12] time did you catch
[4507.64] it so he is telling a woman to marry his
[4511.48] adopted son his own cousin zanab to
[4514.40] marry his adopted son Zade so here Allah
[4518.08] and Muhammad in other words bless the
[4520.48] marriage
[4521.68] right yeah okay what kind of God
[4525.56] and what kind of
[4527.76] prophet breaks this so-called
[4532.88] marriage well if God ordained the
[4535.56] marriage he can end the marriage no uh
[4538.56] so God your God can
[4542.28] play the advocate for Muhammad's penis
[4545.64] and force two married people who even
[4549.12] consumated the marriage together to
[4552.08] destroy that marriage and you claim
[4554.08] that's God to destroy the marriage
[4556.12] between a man and his wife so that that
[4559.08] wife can go to
[4561.16] Muhammad surely God can do it you don't
[4563.72] know all the all the background of it
[4566.20] you don't know all the thoughts that the
[4568.48] man of that wife had during his lifetime
[4571.48] you don't know what the woman went
[4573.32] through and you don't know what the
[4574.92] prophet had there a lot of things behind
[4578.92] it we don't know we have no idea it's
[4581.40] very difficult can you tell me can you
[4583.20] tell me could it be disliked her in
[4586.16] secret could it be that he disliked her
[4588.04] in secret could be there could be
[4589.56] there's a lot of hypotheticals that we
[4591.16] have to regard so wait wait wait second
[4593.36] just a second I want you to say clearly
[4595.80] that
[4597.52] all did a great sin and then so God said
[4600.60] well because of you sinned like that I
[4603.40] will give you s show me show me the
[4606.68] evidence you are are giving us
[4609.40] assumption on top of assumption on I I
[4612.16] told you to be careful brother Z is a
[4615.28] Muslim that is the principle no that is
[4617.76] the principle this is how a huge claim
[4620.80] show me that Z committed a huge sin and
[4623.36] that's why Allah intervened and took
[4625.12] away his wife Z and to give it to I'm
[4627.16] saying this is how utilizing assumptions
[4630.28] for uh God's wisdom in order to order
[4634.64] Allah stealing the wife of Zade and
[4636.48] giving her to Muhammad in order to
[4639.00] regard God's wisdom and be at peace with
[4641.80] his decisions you do positive
[4644.00] assumptions right you use oh it could be
[4647.00] because of this because of that and then
[4648.60] it makes sense you you build up a lot of
[4651.36] reason why
[4652.76] Allah are good give me the reason why
[4656.24] Allah stole the wife of Zade the adopted
[4659.72] son of Muhammad at that time is it was
[4662.36] he was called Z the son of Muhammad IB
[4665.76] Muhammad son of Muhammad why oh why did
[4669.16] Allah destroy that marriage between a
[4671.64] married couple just to give the fagina
[4674.60] of Z to to muhamad maybe it was
[4677.00] destroyed before that we don't know we
[4678.96] cannot look into the marriage exactly
[4681.32] Islam is a religion of may you you are
[4683.80] following a religion and you worship a
[4685.44] god of maybe maybe this and maybe that
[4687.88] is that how it works for your you have
[4690.16] positive th% Jesus christau us could
[4694.16] could there be let me assume since you
[4696.72] are assuming much weum positive about of
[4701.08] the relig let us assume that Muhammad is
[4702.88] a false prophet and he's literally wants
[4705.04] to steal people's wives now that is
[4708.36] assuming against God and against the
[4710.24] truth and that is not good those are pro
[4713.20] prove that Muhammad in this case is not
[4715.40] literally just he's a false prophet he
[4718.16] claims to be a prophet and he's lying
[4720.60] about himself he's lying that there's
[4722.24] something called Allah and it's not a
[4724.28] fabricated just a second let me finish
[4726.12] brother let me finish prove to me that
[4728.48] Muhammad is a true Prophet who is not
[4730.48] stealing people's wives it's actually
[4732.24] divine revelation from Allah prove it M
[4735.32] no so there's no proof here because
[4737.12] we're dealing with faith there's
[4738.36] evidence so let's get Gathering the
[4740.76] evidence God is speaking directly to the
[4743.12] prophet Muhammad and as we have built up
[4745.48] many positive assumptions here we can
[4747.80] easily justify that um like morally of
[4751.16] course what is the evidence what is the
[4753.44] evidence because we did all of those
[4754.88] assumptions and we can see the potential
[4757.96] wisdom okay what the what is the wisdom
[4761.08] behind Allah stealing Allah breaking a
[4763.40] marriage literally breaking a marriage
[4766.56] like uh you know uh Kim kashan and what
[4770.28] was his name breaking their marriage all
[4773.44] forcing the marriage to be broken after
[4775.96] blessing just a second brother brother
[4777.80] brother stop stop let me finish please
[4781.20] I'm giving you a platform allow me to
[4783.56] finish what is the wisdom if you claim
[4786.32] that that the god that you worship is
[4788.60] Allah what is the Divine wisdom behind
[4791.64] Allah that he first start from eight
[4795.72] first He blesses the marriage between
[4798.96] Zab and the adopted son of Muhammad ZB
[4802.64] Muhammad Muhammad goes and he marries
[4805.24] the two by the Divine decree of Allah
[4807.84] they get married then suddenly Allah
[4810.52] changes his mind you claim that this
[4812.20] still the same God Allah changes his
[4814.52] mind just a second let me finish I know
[4817.20] it's hard for you to not allow me to
[4818.56] finish then Allah for some
[4822.12] reason destroys that marriage
[4825.36] destroys that marriage and he says you
[4828.52] know what Muhammad I'm going now to
[4830.84] marry your daughter-in law because
[4833.96] Muhammad lusted after her and the
[4836.28] scholars explained that Muhammad started
[4839.12] to lust after her Zade had no other
[4841.28] option but to divorce her and give her
[4842.96] to Muhammad to be
[4845.84] effed and you see that's Divine wisdom
[4848.52] that's Allah is God Allah is not a pimp
[4851.12] for Muhammad whenever Muhammad lusts
[4853.72] after married women
[4855.64] and you in in the beginning when you
[4856.92] joined you you were okay with it that
[4859.52] Muhammad whenever he lost after a
[4861.56] married even his adopted
[4863.52] son let me rephrase my question let me
[4866.68] rephrase my question here's here's my
[4869.00] here's how I want to rephrase my
[4870.88] question brother
[4872.84] M brother
[4876.00] M um would you would you lost after
[4881.48] your son's wife
[4887.52] would you lost after her no why why
[4890.92] would that be not
[4893.92] good it's not
[4896.36] mine she's not
[4901.20] yours well Muhammad did it she became
[4911.32] his
[4913.08] hello you left
[4915.40] hello are you still
[4917.84] there who you
[4920.36] you yeah I thought uh someone someone
[4923.76] joined I don't know how he could join
[4925.32] but yeah people can join whenever they
[4928.52] like but okay um so so you're you're
[4931.08] okay with that you're okay that you lost
[4933.00] off absolutely yeah I'm absolutely okay
[4935.20] I would say that the prophet um was
[4937.56] absolutely a prophet of God there and we
[4939.56] don't know if the marriage was broken
[4941.44] before that if it was broken by the man
[4944.60] himself disliking his wife or telling
[4947.24] God hey God I don't really want that
[4949.00] wife anymore we don't know the life of
[4951.00] that person at this heart Etc so I trust
[4954.00] in the wisdom of God in his decision and
[4956.24] there's nothing that I can do against
[4958.44] this decision of God I I assume the best
[4960.60] out of God I assume that he did it
[4962.60] absolutely justifiable and that the
[4964.20] prophet also had a reason to do that
[4967.00] maybe he got a dream or something about
[4968.84] her getting a confirmation of God
[4971.40] telling him hey um that marriage is
[4974.16] already broken now you have to actualize
[4976.24] it by marrying that woman so you're not
[4978.72] going
[4979.84] to yeah so from your words
[4983.52] rights about yeah you yourself you
[4986.92] yourself would not last after your uh
[4989.64] wife's the wife of your son
[4992.12] right no I wouldn't because don't have
[4995.32] div re just to make sure you're okay
[4997.80] with Muhammad doing that to his own
[5000.40] son yes if he has Divine Revelations for
[5003.96] that happy recorded now look look what
[5006.68] happened to Zade whenever he wanted to
[5008.40] approach his wife so if we go to
[5013.80] the by IM volume 17 look what it says
[5018.44] for chapter 33 ayat 37 of the Quran
[5020.92] still same chapter look what it says in
[5023.36] the
[5029.04] bottom if Zade wanted to approach Zab
[5031.92] I.E to have intercourse with her with
[5033.96] his own wife life Allah started to make
[5037.72] his penis become swollen so Zade went to
[5041.16] Muhammad and complained and told him
[5043.08] that he wanted to divorce Zab that's the
[5045.80] reason why
[5047.88] Zade wanted to divorce Zab because
[5050.76] knowing that Allah wanted to keep the
[5052.96] vagina of his own wife for
[5057.28] Muhammad
[5058.84] yeah God used that method yeah seems
[5062.68] Seems like a method that actually work
[5065.28] so Allah blowing inside PE uh men's uh
[5068.56] uh penises swalling them that like a
[5071.28] balloon right making them swollen like a
[5076.92] balloon are you still okay with
[5082.64] that
[5085.60] what
[5089.08] sorry like I
[5092.84] said yeah exactly so yeah if God saw the
[5096.20] marriage already broken and already
[5098.00] declining Etc Allah made that
[5103.36] happen the marriage who made that
[5105.56] marriage broken who made that marriage
[5107.60] broken
[5109.56] Z that is something now that is
[5111.68] something that we don't know yes we know
[5113.68] because Allah is making his know that
[5117.72] yeah that could be the final straw that
[5119.92] broke that finalized everything but it
[5122.48] looks like there were underlying
[5123.76] problems before pen become like a
[5125.52] balloon brother brother according to
[5128.00] your scholar and in this case IM
[5130.72] explaining the Ayah who made who made
[5134.32] the penis of Zade swollen like a balloon
[5139.60] who again you're um being too explicit
[5143.44] here no I'm reading the text so reading
[5146.40] your text becomes read text but you
[5148.20] should appropriate to an to an extent so
[5150.48] that I can address the issue not
[5152.16] directly
[5155.92] his penis became
[5158.08] swollen exactly so who made that happen
[5161.40] Allah
[5163.92] why it looks it looks like that divorce
[5167.24] was already going on there were some
[5168.80] underlying issues there and who made
[5170.72] that happen who made the divorce happen
[5172.56] who made that divorce possible by who
[5174.32] who finalized it uh it looks like sadly
[5177.48] it looks like um it might have been zage
[5180.04] or the woman herself one of them it
[5183.04] looks like so wait who who made his
[5185.00] penis swollen who made his penis
[5189.28] swollen disase yeah so Allah intervened
[5192.88] and started to blow up like a balloon he
[5196.20] blowed up his penis so that his penis
[5198.60] stopped working and he could not have
[5200.68] intercourse with his beloved wife why
[5203.68] because Allah wanted to make sure that
[5206.16] the fagina of Zab would have being
[5208.80] preserved like the Quran is being
[5210.36] preserved according to you Muslims to
[5212.84] for the fagina of Z to be preserved for
[5215.20] Muhammad and Muhammad alone
[5217.56] right that's the Divine wisdom of Allah
[5220.08] right thank you and you
[5222.32] this finalize the divorce to make it
[5224.64] pretty easy for the man to divorce her
[5226.92] as well okay and and you think this is
[5229.00] this is not Satan this is
[5230.80] all no it looks pretty Divine actually
[5233.84] like um being having a biological issue
[5236.76] to not want that woman anyways because
[5239.20] you
[5240.20] didn't nod
[5244.56] Abdul Abdul you're lying that's not what
[5247.40] the text says the text says he wants to
[5250.40] approach her whenever he wanted to
[5253.12] approach her
[5255.96] look stop
[5260.20] interrupting whenever he wanted to
[5262.92] approach Zab approach meaning to F her
[5266.20] so whenever the husband the son of uh
[5270.24] the the son of Muhammad whenever the
[5272.24] husband came and wanted to have
[5273.64] intercourse
[5275.32] the son why are you interrupting you
[5277.72] want me to kick you want do you want me
[5280.16] to kick you why why do you keep
[5281.80] interrupting like a donkey I don't want
[5283.88] to insult you brother but stop
[5285.52] interrupting I'm reading have some have
[5287.68] some honor have some
[5289.36] dignity it says whenever Zade wanted to
[5292.04] approach his wife his P started to be
[5295.20] swollen can can I interrupt for a second
[5297.76] but you I did not finish I did not
[5300.72] finish yeah but the problem yeah but the
[5302.68] problem is you interrupted me as well so
[5304.60] it I can interrupt you whenever I want I
[5307.40] can interrupt you whenever I want this
[5308.80] is my live stream you don't like it you
[5311.12] can so so so again you are okay and why

[5322.36] husband so let's say you want to sleep

[5355.40] formulating it in a way that is not
[5358.08] appropriate okay so so Allah blown up
[5361.28] somebody's balloon I mean penis to
[5364.20] become a balloon just because some guy
[5367.48] some friend or some father this case a
[5370.68] father is blowing up he wants to have

[5376.92] Allah intervenes and you okay with that
[5378.64] I want you to say I'm okay with it say
[5381.92] it do you want the TR full truth yet
[5384.96] this is absolutely okay for God to
[5386.80] intervene into any marriage at any point
[5389.72] um the marriage itself was lived by
[5392.00] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[5394.20] for saying it because now we got you
[5396.44] recorded guys Muslims are okay with this
[5401.04] God of theirs with
[5403.64] Allah coming between a husband and a
[5407.48] wife intervening between a man and his
[5411.20] wife who wants to who has all
[5416.08] the authority the green light to sleep
[5418.84] with your wife it's his wife he wants to
[5420.56] approach her Allah does what Allah
[5422.44] intervenes and blows up his a penis
[5424.64] because he wanted to keep the vagina
[5426.92] preserved for
[5428.84] Muhammad so who made that
[5434.76] marriage being
[5436.72] broken Allah yet Allah the hypocrit he
[5440.92] was the one in the
[5442.96] beginning who sent down the verse to
[5445.56] force zanab to get married to the son of
[5447.84] Muhammad what kind of God breaks the
[5450.16] marriage only for the penis and only for
[5452.28] the penis of Muhammad
[5456.32] the only Miracle is guys the only
[5458.40] Miracle listen carefully the only
[5460.72] miracle in Islam is that there are over
[5463.20] two billion Muslims they claim that they
[5465.08] are two billion not us that there are
[5467.32] two over two billion Muslims out there
[5469.08] who believe that Muhammad is a true
[5470.48] Prophet that's the only Miracle guys
[5473.12] they have to throw their
[5476.52] own human nature under the bus their
[5480.20] morality is under the bus just for the
[5482.56] penis of Muhammad you heard heard him
[5484.32] guys I didn't want to kick him because I
[5486.92] I wanted him to be recorded for everyone
[5489.68] to hear and
[5491.60] see that they actually truly worship
[5494.64] Muhammad and his penis the real worship
[5497.32] of Muhammad and penis and his penis in
[5499.80] front of
[5500.92] you they believe that
[5504.96] Muhammad
[5506.72] has the privilege to steal someone
[5509.84] else's wife and blaming Allah for it
[5512.88] Allah made that happen Allah made that
[5515.64] possible yet what kind of God first
[5519.12] blesses the marriage
[5521.48] between Zab and the adopted son of
[5524.52] Muhammad Zade Muhammad then Allah
[5527.76] himself breaks that marriage and cause
[5530.44] it to be destroyed why because
[5533.76] Muhammad's lust for his
[5538.68] daughter-in-law actually today Michael
[5540.72] they are not trying to prove us wrong
[5541.88] they are agreeing with us because they
[5544.28] are seeing that everything we are
[5545.48] showing is from their books today they
[5547.84] are not disagreeing with us they
[5550.12] agreeing with us that Islam is created
[5552.68] by the penis of Muhammad for Muhammad's
[5557.56] penis everything is created by the penis
[5560.20] for the penis of
[5565.00] Muhammad let's
[5569.60] see are there more Muslims guys
[5579.64] any
[5582.28] Muslim
[5584.36] hello hello Ibrahim welcome yeah hello
[5587.72] thank
[5589.28] you what do you think uh about today's
[5592.04] top what is this what is this discussion
[5594.20] about the discussion is that Allah Allah
[5597.60] wanted to the fagina of zanab his own
[5601.08] daughter-in-law the daughter-in-law of
[5602.80] Muhammad to be preserved for
[5604.76] Muhammad okay could you prove that
[5607.12] please
[5608.64] sure let us start from the beginning
[5611.00] since you we're not here maybe in the
[5613.08] beginning if you go to chapter 33 ayat
[5616.88] 36 it says it's not for a believing man
[5619.56] or believing women when Allah and his
[5621.32] messenger have decided a matter that
[5623.36] they should have any choice about their
[5625.48] uh Affair and whoever disobeys Allah and
[5627.64] his messenger has certainly strayed into
[5629.44] clear eror so my question is what is
[5632.48] this Ayah about
[5635.36] um I'm not sure what this ay is about
[5637.52] have you read
[5638.80] the I have not read the T yet no I did
[5642.72] and when I read
[5643.88] the the for it was here in
[5648.88] for pick any Tere in this case we don't
[5652.76] like we don't like we don't like we like
[5655.56] to pick our cherries okay which
[5658.08] taper I
[5660.28] take
[5662.72] who oh you are you Shia yes ah you're
[5666.76] Shia okay what
[5669.24] does says about this I can open it right
[5672.40] now I have the let me see so you are
[5676.04] you're not a Sunni you're Shia okay no
[5677.96] problem yes I am
[5679.33] [Music]
[5681.04] Shia I'm not sure why it would come up
[5683.32] while I'm talking L about Sunny books
[5685.52] but sure no problem Oh I did not know it
[5687.40] was about new books
[5689.08] so okay so basically the the verse says
[5693.08] and then married Z to Z she was from the
[5697.72] CL
[5698.60] of and she was a daughter of the
[5700.64] paternal Aunt of so she said until there
[5704.00] are orders for myself I shall wait so
[5706.48] Allah revealed 3336 so she said my life
[5709.24] is in your hands so he got her married
[5711.28] to him Zade so she remained with Zade
[5713.76] for as long as Allah so desired it then
[5716.08] they quarrel about something so um so
[5719.28] the prophet looked towards her and she
[5720.88] astounded him Zade said oh allow me to
[5723.72] divorce her or she is arrogant and she
[5725.96] hurts me with her tongue so that's why
[5728.56] that's what actually happened
[5731.36] M yeah okay so there's nothing in your
[5735.84] sources in your sh sources that says uh
[5738.80] that Muhammad losted after no okay
[5742.88] beautiful no we believe that they had a
[5744.44] bad marriage and that's why they
[5746.00] divorced okay so you you do not believe
[5749.60] as
[5750.56] Shia that like the Sunni sources that
[5753.68] Muhammad lusted after her and because in
[5755.64] the Islam in the Sunni books it says
[5757.96] that Muhammad one day he entered the
[5759.64] house of his adopted son all right and
[5763.08] he saw
[5764.44] zanab looking basically like uh you know
[5768.28] like uh half naked and he says to her
[5773.04] glory to
[5775.48] Allah sub glory to Allah who turns
[5780.04] Hearts sowing are half naked you don't
[5782.64] have something like that
[5784.68] sources no not that I've seen no this
[5787.20] doesn't not that you've seen or is it
[5789.12] not is it there not at all no I have not
[5791.80] seen any of it in our sources it's not
[5793.52] mentioned in our sources
[5795.28] no it's not mentioned basically what
[5797.72] happened was zanab and um Zade they
[5800.80] married their marriage didn't go well so
[5802.64] they
[5803.68] divorced so the sunnis are kufar for
[5807.80] attributing this to
[5810.24] Muhammad yeah it's it's like a Christian
[5812.96] saying Jesus lusted at someone it's a
[5814.84] it's apostasy it's blasphemy it's
[5817.24] blasphemy so you they are kuf they are
[5820.84] huge kufar when they say that about
[5823.56] Allah well it's it's apostasy it's
[5825.96] blasphemy if if someone says that yeah
[5828.68] okay thank you okay yeah basically like
[5831.12] for example is lust a worldly desire yes
[5833.52] or no well uh uh for me of course my
[5837.32] Bible is very clear you know if you lost
[5839.88] one of the Ten Commandments one of the
[5842.20] top ten commandments is if uh if you
[5844.32] lost after somebody's wife you're
[5846.80] committing a huge sin now I believe that
[5849.20] that is true if I I read this Sunni
[5851.92] books I see that the prophet of Islam
[5854.04] broke all Ten Commandments all Sunni
[5856.96] Prophet is a joke yeah that's true and
[5859.28] we do know that since lust is a worldly
[5861.56] desire the prophet does not have worldly
[5863.36] desires so if he did towards another
[5866.48] woman then that would nullify his
[5867.72] prophit hood thank you you see this is
[5869.88] why I always say brother I always say
[5872.44] people who know me people following me I
[5874.52] always say Shia Muslims are the real
[5876.28] Muslims not the sunnis because literally
[5878.92] the Sunni books made Muhammad look like
[5880.96] a
[5881.72] joke
[5883.96] exactly yeah I agree with you I was
[5886.12] Sunni for over a year oh you left Sunni
[5889.00] Islam yes I did leave Sunni Islam why
[5891.44] did you leave Sunni Islam brother well I
[5893.76] saw all the contradictions in the Hadith
[5895.40] and I saw like with it from our point of
[5897.24] view Shia Islam made much more sense
[5899.32] than Sunni Islam because we are logical
[5901.84] we use reasoning and the hadiths always
[5904.36] Point more towards the Shia perspective
[5906.16] rather than the Sunni perspective
[5907.44] because I know even Inari it's such a
[5908.96] joke like the way they describe the
[5910.88] prophet so okay then I have a question
[5914.04] for you because you are now Shia right
[5916.80] yes I am okay beautiful uh what do you
[5919.68] think about the book called alfi alfi
[5923.36] Beautiful book amazing book it's very
[5925.32] authentic do you speak Arabic do you
[5927.72] read Arabic no I do not
[5929.27] [Music]
[5930.32] no um what do you think about if I can
[5934.32] show you something in the Shia
[5936.20] Books Okay you can do that thank you
[5939.40] Adam for the donation God bless you if
[5941.92] uh I found something troubling you know
[5943.96] I you know if I would consider Shia
[5945.64] Islam I would have not accepted it
[5947.92] because of the thing that I saw in the
[5950.72] Shia books and here is one of them in
[5953.40] one of the sh I found this and this is
[5956.36] in alfi volume 3 page
[5960.36] 163 it's on the screen do you want me
[5962.76] can you read it for me please so fromd
[5967.20] he was asked what is the matter with the
[5969.16] dead he said the sperm which he was
[5970.72] created from is thrown out from Ali the
[5973.40] son of Al Hussein a creature does not
[5975.60] die um until the sperm from which he was
[5978.08] created comes out of his mouth or his
[5980.04] eye so first of all um EDI Which chapter
[5983.56] in volume three that's very
[5985.92] important this is this is a very yes
[5989.96] this is the
[5991.32] book Ali do you see
[5994.16] I have the physical book it's volume
[5995.92] three volume three but which chapter in
[5998.80] volume three okay let me show you which
[6001.92] one because I can open it right now so
[6006.44] M let's see that is
[6014.28] a uh let's see let me open it from my
[6017.28] side because you Muslims also sh Muslims
[6019.96] you have also your websites so let's see
[6022.20] if I have the correct
[6026.04] one okay here's the first Hadith that
[6028.60] you read so the Hadith on top
[6031.00] here this is the first
[6033.60] one you know this website
[6036.48] right yes I do okay volume 3 book three
[6040.76] chapter
[6041.72] 32 and then look what it says Hadith
[6044.12] number
[6045.24] three okay so this is the first
[6048.16] one okay it's volume three which
[6051.88] book book number
[6054.96] three okay chapter 32 Hadith number
[6059.12] three okay I see it now
[6062.72] okay that's the first and then we can
[6065.16] move to the second
[6067.84] one okay so yes I've read this Hadith
[6071.92] now this is the first time I've seen
[6073.68] this Hadith so what do you
[6076.60] think the there's two different meanings
[6079.12] for this there's the zah meaning and the
[6081.08] meaning the zah is the apparent which we
[6083.08] don't believe that when it comes to
[6084.52] something like this science disproves
[6086.64] the apparent meaning so there must be a
[6087.88] hidden
[6089.32] meaning so what do you
[6092.00] think so for this Hadith I don't know
[6094.20] the explanation for but it must be
[6095.64] hidden or esoteric hidden okay beautiful
[6098.24] it's an esoteric Hadith yeah because
[6100.20] some hadiths are very apparent and
[6101.76] literal and some are
[6104.96] esoteric so you don't have a problem
[6107.04] with this Hadith be honest this Hadith
[6109.96] um I do not understand you believe you
[6111.52] believe that uh let's say you you are
[6114.00] alive right you and me we are both alive
[6117.04] according to Al
[6121.04] Hussein he said that a human let's say a
[6123.60] human or a goat maybe a donkey or a cow
[6126.88] any living creature does not die until
[6129.88] the seed from which it is created comes
[6132.64] out his body from his mouth or his eye
[6137.28] so according to this
[6138.96] wisdom the seed of your
[6141.52] father who made your mother
[6144.80] pregnant will be alive in you so your
[6149.00] father's sperm let's say will stay in
[6151.88] your body as long you are alive and when
[6153.96] you die the seed of your father his
[6156.84] sperm cell will come either out of your
[6159.24] mouth or or your
[6161.44] eye so a good explanation for this
[6163.76] Hadith it is not the apparent meaning
[6165.44] it's the hidden meaning so the seed is
[6167.00] the soul so when you die the soul leaves
[6168.88] your body through your mouth or your ey
[6170.84] to be honest with you brother if I
[6173.64] yeah but if I if I just look at it I
[6176.56] would say ew brother brother ew yes the
[6180.20] seed of my father's in me all all of my
[6182.48] life until I die and it will come out of
[6185.40] my my mouth and eye this is like a
[6187.72] little little very bad bad bad bad very
[6191.20] bad script very bad movie
[6193.24] brother yes because this is the apparent
[6195.52] meaning but we don't go by for this okay
[6198.16] what about the second Hadith that that I
[6200.68] mentioned which is the second Hadith oh
[6203.40] I didn't mention that one here's the
[6204.80] other one let me show you which one I'm
[6206.56] talking about what about the same book
[6208.88] same
[6210.08] book but the following Hadith let me
[6213.28] show
[6218.84] you so let's say this Hadith you know we
[6221.64] throw it under the garbage or under the
[6224.12] carpet we don't like it we don't take it
[6226.80] what about the following one same
[6230.04] book same book
[6233.32] it's a very long
[6235.16] Hadith Hadith number
[6237.76] four book one chapter 6 these are Shia
[6241.12] hadiths people in the chat okay Shi
[6245.36] okay sh hadiths Hadith number four I
[6250.12] think if I'm not mistaken if I click
[6253.20] here do you see
[6255.36] it yes we believe every is every single
[6259.60] one every single one is well I would
[6262.72] saybe 99% there's like every um every
[6265.92] once in a while there's a very rare
[6267.28] Hadith which could be
[6268.56] weak I've heard say it's even more
[6271.24] authentic than sahkari of the sunnis
[6273.32] right absolutely yeah absolutely
[6275.56] beautiful now I want you to read with me
[6278.04] okay brother I want you to read it's a
[6280.16] very long Hadith but let's say we start
[6282.56] from here you know it's about talking
[6284.04] about uh how how the embryology stages
[6287.40] work in Shia Islam right so if we start
[6291.00] reading let's say from here he inspires
[6293.76] the womb to open its door so that his
[6297.08] creature can enter it and his autor of
[6300.08] determination and measure now here's the
[6303.52] most important part the womb opens his
[6306.84] door let me make it bigger the womb
[6309.72] opens its door oh yeah here he inspires
[6313.40] to open its door so so that the creature
[6315.88] can enter it and is aor okay d w open
[6318.92] its door and the seed reaches to
[6321.80] WB that turns back and forth for 40 days
[6326.52] then it becomes a cloth you agree with
[6329.68] this yes it's simple yeah you agree with
[6333.60] this yes because even scientifically we
[6336.44] know that um during um when when a baby
[6341.64] is conceived um the woman her Anatomy um
[6346.08] during intercourse it opens up it opens
[6348.64] up it goes wide during it so yeah of
[6351.24] course the wom technically does open it
[6353.32] door like not literally it has a door
[6355.96] but it widens and opens so so you
[6358.36] believe that Seaman
[6359.96] travels in the wom for 40 days then it
[6363.88] becomes a cloth you believe in that you
[6366.68] believe that science agree with this yes
[6369.72] basically again there's two ways to
[6371.68] interpret Hadith either the apparent
[6373.52] meeting or the esoteric meeting okay so
[6375.96] we take both for different types of Hadi
[6378.28] this one it could be um this one is not
[6380.16] the apparent meaning apparent meaning so
[6382.32] then turns it Back 40 days cuz we know
[6384.36] after 40 days it becomes a clot okay no
[6387.04] that's when it travels no you missed you
[6388.60] missed an essential part because I have
[6390.28] a I have a surprise for you uh what did
[6392.88] I miss sperm that has been ejaculated in
[6396.28] the woman can live inside the womb the
[6398.88] uterus for a maximum of five
[6402.96] days could you which scientific
[6405.28] reference is this any scientific
[6407.16] reference Google it all
[6411.56] right so
[6413.60] we have a problem with science if if we
[6415.72] have to believe in the Shia that are
[6417.72] authentic and you said it's authentic
[6419.76] and I'm happy that you said it and we
[6422.40] prove that it's
[6423.52] authentic so being Shia brother what I'm
[6427.48] trying to say is being
[6429.32] Shia you have to throw away science you
[6432.84] have to believe in the Shan
[6435.16] books modern day modern day
[6438.28] embryologist will
[6440.04] call alfi a big fat joke
[6444.68] okay could I see the Hadith again real
[6446.04] quick sure
[6451.48] okay and then when you're done I want
[6453.56] you to explain to me what a blood clot
[6456.48] is this is not a a blood clot it's just
[6459.16] a clot like it says a blood clot it says
[6461.64] in the Arabic blood clot okay so yeah
[6464.68] this is um during very early um fet what
[6467.04] is a blood clot brother so here we have
[6469.28] here is a mistake already because Sean
[6471.96] does not stay
[6473.40] steam does not stay for 40 days in the
[6475.88] wom that's already scientifically
[6478.80] disproven what is a blood
[6481.36] clot this is after the yeah so so then
[6484.80] it says the
[6486.36] SE so it's still SEMA
[6489.24] right not for 40 days it SW it it say
[6492.24] turns back and forth it says no no no no
[6494.64] no you're you're misreading brother you
[6496.80] see moments ago we already said you know
[6498.80] Sunni Islam is a big F fed comedy show
[6501.92] but brother look what it say says the
[6503.68] seed so seed means sperm cell n that's
[6507.36] the Arabic if you go to the Arabic it
[6508.64] says n okay is drop of
[6512.88] semen okay yes so this drop of semen
[6516.08] it's in the womb for how many days it
[6518.04] goes back and forth It's traveling as if
[6520.88] it has his own life it keeps going back
[6523.96] and forth for 40 long
[6526.44] days moments ago we showed that science
[6530.36] of the day embryology
[6532.84] this proves that contradicts that but
[6535.88] okay then it becomes a
[6539.00] cloth have you ever seen seen becoming
[6541.60] cloth a blood
[6543.16] cloth no I have not it becomes a clot
[6546.08] basically what is a blood cloth what is
[6548.28] a cloth a blood clot is when um what a
[6551.48] blood CL together that's that's what a
[6553.44] blood clot is what is a blood clot a
[6555.96] blood clot is a clot of blood that's is
[6558.40] it is it dead or dead dead so you
[6562.48] believe believe that seman in the womb
[6564.08] of your mother that traveled for 40 days
[6566.96] will
[6568.28] die die now again and you know after
[6571.00] becoming a blood clot it will die so
[6573.92] what are what what can we what what what
[6575.64] do we just learn from this that means
[6577.80] you are basically Living Dead you a
[6580.32] zombie in the womb of your mother de BL
[6583.08] again there's two different meanings
[6584.60] there's the apparent and then the
[6585.84] esoteric if we look at the esoteric
[6588.12] meaning the clot could be the early um
[6590.68] early clump of Flesh when um right after
[6593.60] the baby was conceived but brother what
[6595.52] happened what happened with the egg the
[6596.96] egg uh run run out of the womb of the
[6600.12] woman this was after it fertilized where
[6603.04] where where where does it say fertilize
[6604.68] where show me show me in the Arabic this
[6607.40] is show me where talking about where's
[6609.48] the egg mentioned there's no egg it's
[6611.52] talking about n that's what it's talking
[6613.72] about yes it mentions where okay where's
[6616.08] where's the
[6617.52] B that's not where's the where's the egg
[6620.40] what happened to the egg it's not
[6621.44] mention it's not not exist it does not
[6624.44] exist in Islam at all it's not does not
[6626.92] exist in the Quran it does not exist in
[6629.16] the if you want to be either Sunni Shia
[6632.64] whatever you are I don't care which sex
[6634.36] you follow you have to believe that
[6636.04] women have no eggs at all because
[6639.04] according to the Quran go let us go to
[6640.96] the Quran same story look if we go to
[6643.44] the Quran brother look chapter
[6646.24] 23 Ayah 14 the Quran is not corrupted
[6649.20] right brother no it is it is it is it is
[6653.72] the Quran is
[6654.84] corrupted
[6657.48] yes the Quran is corrupted
[6662.48] yes
[6664.12] unbelievable are you akbari I am akbari
[6668.20] ah so you are a type of Shia who
[6670.72] believes that the Quran is corrupted if
[6673.32] if I read the following Ayah for you you
[6675.08] think it's
[6676.08] corrupted um no because we we know which
[6678.44] eyes are corrupted and which one isn't
[6679.96] okay is this one corrupted brother let
[6682.32] me and it's 2314 so this one no this one
[6686.76] is not corrupted this one is not
[6689.08] corrupted okay chapter 23 ay 14 read
[6692.04] with me therefore we created the sperm a
[6700.00] cloth the word is a blood
[6703.36] clot that Frozen blood you see that the
[6706.40] Quran and your Hadith agrees with one
[6708.40] another so we have first we have n this
[6711.12] is a wrong translation because nah means
[6713.44] a drop of semen so here they are not
[6716.28] correct in the translation then it says
[6718.96] the semen the drop of SE becomes a blood
[6724.12] clot it's a mistake turns into a CL it's
[6726.84] a mistake what happened to the egg so we
[6729.56] see um and then from our view of the
[6732.20] Quran it says then we created the seed
[6734.04] to be a clot that's what yeah but
[6735.60] where's the egg what happened to the egg
[6736.96] somebody ate the egg the egg the egg is
[6739.00] not mentioned so the egg is not
[6740.80] mentioned it does not exist thank you
[6742.64] you it does exist it's just mentioned in
[6744.52] the show me show me where it's not
[6746.76] mentioned in this verse but it exists
[6748.96] science yeah science disagree no no no
[6751.64] it does not uh if you if you know your
[6755.12] Quran brother let me tell you
[6756.72] straightforward your Quran is stolen
[6758.32] from the work of
[6760.08] galin galin who lived 500 years at least
[6763.84] before Islam before your
[6765.68] prophet in his book in in his in his
[6768.96] works we know that Galen said that women
[6771.92] have seen
[6773.28] and men have seen and when the seen of a
[6775.76] woman that comes from her uh chest area
[6779.24] let's say from the rib cage from the
[6781.20] necklace area you know have you ever
[6783.00] seen a woman with a necklace yes that
[6786.04] part of her body the rib cage the
[6788.60] necklace area women in Islam according
[6791.08] to the Quran and your Hadith agree with
[6793.52] this that Sean comes from there she
[6796.84] doesn't have eggs she has semen she has
[6798.84] nah and the N of a man comes from not
[6803.00] from his ball sack it comes from his
[6804.64] backbone and you can find this also in
[6806.72] the Quran in chapter 86 ay 7 86y 7 let
[6810.40] me open no back to back with this ey
[6814.12] look let me put it on the screen
[6817.35] [Music]
[6820.80] mhm emerging from between the backbone
[6823.48] and the
[6824.68] ribs ejaculated fluid the backbone of
[6828.44] the man and the ribs of the
[6831.28] woman okay okay yes and our of this
[6834.64] Quran of this Quran vers because we know
[6836.40] during early fetal development um when
[6839.04] the body is just a clot it's all clumped
[6840.68] up of Flesh um but brother what happened
[6844.20] to the what you believe you believe that
[6846.28] women have seen no that's what the Quran
[6852.28] says it gushes out it gushes out from
[6855.32] between the B bone and the ribs of the
[6857.80] woman so you believe when you get
[6859.28] married that your wife can gush semen
[6861.28] out of a rib say women where does it say
[6863.96] women what do you think the ribs is
[6865.84] about the ribs that can mention men show
[6869.76] me one sh that says this is not about
[6872.20] the woman so we already have I already
[6875.04] opened the for this yes and so the the
[6879.92] refers to who what refers to the men or
[6883.20] the
[6884.24] women I don't speak Arabic so okay the
[6887.60] ribs the tat means ribs brother okay the
[6890.32] ribs yes ribs of who
[6893.08] the ribs of a man has to be
[6895.44] no open the T for me please okay yes I
[6899.28] can which which do you use I
[6903.28] use
[6905.00] okay you mean right yeah
[6918.36] okay let's see if we can find something
[6920.84] like that where where where do you where
[6923.16] do you have access to Alaska stuffs here
[6926.44] I can open I can send you the link in
[6928.24] the s that would be
[6938.28] awesome so right
[6940.64] here the tip SE is very long for this a
[6943.44] though so yeah no
[6946.88] problem did you put it
[6950.08] uh okay
[6952.64] okay beautiful so you what uh is that
[6955.64] English translation there's English and
[6958.04] Arabic yes
[6972.16] okay mhm
[6985.84] okay do you see the to here yes just a
[6996.84] second blood
[7009.64] okay okay let me put put it on the
[7012.72] screen for everybody to
[7014.40] see
[7022.68] oh this is the T that you sent me thank
[7026.20] you for sending it to me brother in
[7028.04] humanity you're
[7031.52] welcome let's see here is the part he is
[7034.60] creator of water pouring forth coming
[7036.44] from between the back and the ribs so
[7037.88] this is the Ayah chapter 86 and 87 soon
[7041.32] also
[7042.88] okay we go down
[7049.16] N I have never seen this T before
[7051.72] because there are so many of course well
[7054.88] no problem let's
[7056.28] see you said to shall I not ask you
[7059.52] about something which no one would know
[7061.64] except the prophet he said and what is
[7063.96] it Yol Allah he said about the
[7066.24] resemblance of the son of the to his
[7068.16] father and his mother he said the water
[7070.08] of the man is white and thick
[7072.68] and the water of the woman is yellow and
[7074.36] thin do you agree with this
[7077.20] yes a woman's seen is yellow and thin it
[7081.72] doesn't say Sean it says water no no it
[7083.56] says Sean it says water no no it says
[7086.92] Sean referring to
[7089.04] water where does it say
[7094.20] Sean no it only says the the water of
[7096.92] the man is what is the okay what is that
[7099.32] water what do you think the water is the
[7101.56] water of the man is seen But the Water
[7103.52] of the woman is not
[7105.72] seen what yeah because we know even
[7108.92] during intercourse women do produce a
[7110.68] liquid that is not seen it's thin in
[7113.44] yellow okay let us start again from from
[7116.84] zero so the water of the man is white
[7119.68] and thick when it's talking about the
[7122.28] water what is that water this is
[7124.56] referring to Sean and what is the other
[7127.48] water this is referring to the liquid a
[7129.96] woman produces during sexual intercourse
[7132.28] in the Arabic language when we talk
[7136.04] about it's not talking about
[7139.08] Sean I don't speak Arabic so I wouldn't
[7141.44] know well I as an Arabic speaker tell
[7144.56] you that when it's talking about the man
[7146.20] it means seman so let's continue so
[7148.60] women have seen like the men so if the
[7150.56] water of the man is higher than the
[7152.76] water of the woman the child will be
[7156.80] male you agree with this well yeah it's
[7159.84] esoteric so again there's an apparent me
[7162.16] and hidden me okay
[7164.44] beautiful let's see let's
[7167.36] see so you see it's talking about two
[7171.32] sperms it refutes you brother where is
[7174.60] it here oh the next one yeah this is
[7177.80] metaphorical another brother you're
[7180.76] you're not serious right no I'm serious
[7183.80] metaphorical so when when we talk about
[7186.40] sperm sperm becomes uh metaphorical
[7188.88] brother moments ago it wasn't
[7190.72] metaphorical we're talking about
[7192.52] embryology what do you mean metaphorical
[7194.52] you have metaphor in the womb of your
[7196.44] mother you're a metaphor in the womb of
[7198.72] your mother no the actual egg no the egg
[7201.80] is literal yes so a woman has
[7205.36] what a woman has an egg no the woman
[7208.48] have a
[7209.40] sperm because this is esoteric no
[7212.40] brother it's little so if it was the
[7215.60] sperm of the woman you gave me to this
[7218.68] not me it's not my T it's your you gave
[7220.64] it to me your refutes you brother it's
[7223.40] on the
[7224.40] screen okay so again it says two sperms
[7227.72] occupy the womb so whichever so how many
[7230.00] sperms two sperms which sperm the sperm
[7232.20] of a man and the sperm of a woman okay
[7235.40] which is more so a woman's sperm so in
[7238.16] other words brother if you're married
[7239.48] your wife will have more sperm than
[7241.80] you okay anyway let us continue and then
[7245.24] it said the sperm wonders in the man for
[7248.12] 40 wait what for 40 days so the one it
[7252.48] this becomes even more horrible
[7255.12] uh and then we have angels and
[7257.86] [Music]
[7259.56] whatnot women have a sperm do you see
[7263.40] it okay well yeah and and her sperm if
[7266.32] we go back to the
[7267.60] Ayah her sperm comes from where from her
[7270.36] ribs so the first part is about men they
[7273.84] their sperm comes from their backbone
[7275.68] and the sperm of a woman comes from her
[7277.36] ribs you believe women have sperm and it
[7279.08] comes from a from a rib cage Mr all the
[7282.24] verse it where does it say women are
[7283.76] being mentioned because the T never
[7285.20] mentions the the sperm from the woman is
[7287.00] coming from the ribs that's what it it
[7288.68] doesn't say that of course brother
[7290.56] because this part is about the
[7292.40] women this part about about the men
[7294.92] because the T that you're giving me is
[7297.28] talking literally
[7298.80] about two sperms sperm of a man and
[7301.84] sperm of a woman since the AY is talking
[7305.64] about one sperm that comes from the
[7308.04] backbone it must be either the man or
[7310.16] the woman right one comes from
[7312.68] and from
[7315.36] ribs it comes from both between it says
[7318.16] between the back ands as for the
[7321.08] bones oh sorry this not this no wait I
[7324.04] have to go
[7325.40] down the one sperm the sperm of the man
[7329.00] comes from his backbone and the sperm of
[7331.32] the man comes from his from
[7335.00] her ribs okay yeah well that's SE as for
[7339.80] the bones yeah you see from for the man
[7342.92] yeah it comes from between the backbones
[7344.68] and the ribs agree with do you believe
[7346.80] that women have seen
[7348.36] brother women have SP Lal they don't
[7351.04] have
[7351.76] literal they have that's what it
[7354.76] says again there's a esoteric meaning
[7357.08] it's no brother it has nothing to do
[7358.56] with no now you're playing games brother
[7360.60] does not work on me let me tell you
[7361.80] straight ahead the Arabic is in front of
[7363.72] me the Arabic is there is on the screen
[7365.92] and even your and even the translation
[7368.32] that you are giving me this is a
[7369.84] translation disagrees with you and
[7372.36] actually you have to believe that women
[7375.00] have SE their War the water of the woman
[7378.36] is thin and
[7380.32] yellow well yes it is thin and yellow
[7382.60] yes so women have semen that is thin and
[7385.56] yellow the seen it's not like the to be
[7388.16] honest with you if I was a woman and I
[7389.88] see this I would leave Islam immediately
[7391.40] sh all of them
[7394.16] agree
[7396.16] agree they agree on this the sunnis
[7399.60] agree with you
[7402.84] okay so if if I was a Sunni or if I was
[7406.48] Shia and I would be a woman or maybe if
[7408.88] I was married to a woman I would be
[7411.04] really in horror you know why because if
[7412.60] I get married to let's say a Shia Muslim
[7415.48] woman on my wedding day with her there
[7419.00] is a huge possibility that she's going
[7421.00] to leak Sean from her breast
[7426.04] stickles that would be horror imagine if
[7429.24] you are married you get married on on
[7431.92] your wedding night your wife starts to
[7434.24] leak semen from her
[7436.00] breasticles I would be concerned yeah me
[7438.64] too so why she Muslim brother you think
[7440.92] that you left Sunni Islam you told me in
[7442.92] the beginning you left Sunni Islam
[7444.96] because it has many flaws in it here we
[7449.32] see we see the same
[7452.24] flaws what do you think is it not time
[7455.24] to leave Islam in its entirety in its
[7458.08] complete form I
[7460.72] see I think you sound like a very um I
[7464.52] have to give it to you you're a very uh
[7466.92] respectful gentleman and I have noticed
[7469.48] that most Shia Muslims that I've talken
[7471.36] to they're very respectful they are way
[7473.72] different than Sunni Muslims Sunni
[7475.16] Muslim are very aggressive they are very
[7477.72] filthy uh every couple of words is nasty
[7481.84] they love to inter you know even
[7484.00] interrupt me when I'm talking and here
[7485.36] we have we are having an awesome
[7487.00] conversation and I'm glad though because
[7489.52] in the end brother before we we won't
[7492.04] take anything with us except uh the
[7494.12] truth right because only the truth and
[7496.56] only the TR truth will set everybody
[7498.92] free of course I agree with you you left
[7501.40] Sunni Islam because you found out that
[7503.52] Sunni Islam is not the truth then you
[7505.76] moved to Shia Islam and now we are
[7508.16] finding out that Shia Islam has the same
[7511.08] flaws yes and I have seen I do believe
[7514.36] that there is an issue here that I need
[7515.68] to find I and we also went to alfi right
[7518.56] remember alfi we started alfi alfi gree
[7521.40] yes
[7523.04] look what it says here if this is the
[7526.20] that I put earlier on the screen brother
[7527.64] look if you continue reading it becomes
[7529.08] even more horrible look brother why I'm
[7531.48] saying horrible and not because I'm
[7532.92] trying to make a joke out of it no what
[7535.12] I'm seeing is that there are very big
[7538.24] issues here it start about a womb so and
[7543.16] then seon that is traveling the seon of
[7545.40] men and women is traveling so here we
[7548.08] have seen that is mixed right the seen
[7551.20] of the men and and the woman is mixed
[7553.20] and it's traveling back and forth for 40
[7555.64] days we notice that this cannot be 40
[7558.12] days also should be maximum of five days
[7561.16] because science says maximum of five
[7563.24] days then it becomes dead
[7566.60] blood in the Arabic language is frozen
[7569.64] dead blood here this is a false
[7574.24] translation it's not saying embryo in
[7576.40] the
[7577.28] Arabic then the piece of Flesh in which
[7580.52] veins spread like a
[7584.48] there a
[7586.00] problem okay so if we were to go to the
[7588.72] literal um apparent meaning then we
[7590.72] would be completely lost in misguided
[7592.84] yes so the only way is to go through an
[7594.72] esoteric meaning so we see um but even
[7597.56] if we go to the Quran brother look after
[7599.80] the
[7601.12] um this stage so we have Frozen dead
[7604.76] blood if I choose another translation
[7607.56] let's see uh let's see what this
[7610.48] translation says
[7612.84] look congealed blood a clot a BL blood
[7616.56] clot a dead blood clot you see it then
[7619.80] of that clot that blood clot that is
[7622.24] dead so you're dead in this stage
[7624.56] literally you you are not alive okay and
[7627.72] you know what happens to a woman that
[7628.84] has a blood clot in her body you know
[7630.20] what what the risk is what happens your
[7633.96] your mother could
[7635.60] die I see you know why your mother can
[7638.32] die you have any idea why because of the
[7640.08] blood clot yeah the blood clot
[7642.12] a blood clot blocks
[7644.60] veins if if your if your mother if you
[7647.56] are a blood clot because it says it's
[7649.12] you okay if you are a blood clot in the
[7652.12] womb of your
[7653.64] mother you are you yourself your risk to
[7657.20] your mother why here is why this is you
[7661.24] brother this this part is you look do
[7662.84] you see this is a blood vein you are
[7665.52] this you see this this this you see this
[7667.36] part here these are red blood cells this
[7670.64] is you you are blocking literally the
[7673.24] blood veins of your mother the veins of
[7675.28] your mother so if you to become a blood
[7677.56] clot your your your mother could even
[7680.12] die because of you if you believe in the
[7682.60] words of your prophet and
[7684.88] Allah yes because this is the apparent
[7687.12] meaning however no no not parent brother
[7688.92] no no no no no no literal meaning
[7691.00] literally that's what it says it
[7693.20] literally says you are a blood clot your
[7696.52] dead blood in the in the in your
[7698.76] mother's body your mother heard life is
[7701.88] in danger because of you if we believe
[7704.68] in Allah's words right then look what it
[7707.52] says if we continue reading then we made
[7710.44] out of that lump of Flesh bones this is
[7713.96] another mistake if we believe in this
[7716.68] you know what this means
[7718.28] brother look mistake after mistake of
[7720.88] mistake in the Quran if we forget about
[7723.12] the Hadith for for example mistake why
[7726.32] am I saying mistake after mistake
[7727.80] because look according to this part this
[7732.68] here we have another problem with
[7734.84] science why because according to science
[7738.64] Flesh and Bones develop
[7743.60] simultaneously but according to the
[7745.36] Quran you are bones so according to this
[7747.80] Ayah you look like this brother look you
[7751.04] literally look let's see if I you
[7754.28] know uh you look like this in the womb
[7757.32] of your mother what do you think about
[7759.28] this picture if I put the picture Let's
[7761.60] Pretend This is you in the womb of your
[7763.00] mother do you believe you look like this
[7765.28] I don't see any picture on the
[7768.40] screen no I see you believe that you
[7771.60] look like this in the womb of your
[7774.68] mother no I do not believe I look like
[7776.96] that cute baby though this is Halloween
[7778.40] don't get me wrong you know it's
[7779.52] Halloween I have a young kid myself so
[7781.80] my kid would look like this maybe
[7783.24] because you know like I see the comedy
[7785.64] in it but brother if you believe in
[7787.12] Allah's words at this very stage you
[7791.08] have no flesh around your body around
[7793.80] your bones I see so so let's say your
[7797.20] mother I hope not and of course it's not
[7799.44] because you are alive you're already out
[7800.92] of the womb of your mother you're a
[7802.52] grown man let's say but at that very
[7804.76] stage when you in the womb of your
[7807.00] mother let's say your your
[7809.92] mother you know I don't want wish that
[7812.16] for any mother to happen because I have
[7813.84] a wife she's mother of two beautiful
[7816.20] children she gave me two beautiful
[7818.72] children but let's say at this very
[7820.68] stage your mother
[7821.84] sleeps and she loses you in her womb you
[7824.52] die in her womb you get the mother your
[7827.20] mother get gets a
[7829.44] miscarriage we can say to your your
[7832.32] father congratulations you became father
[7835.96] to a skeleton baby a skeleton can comes
[7839.20] out of the vagina of the mother looking
[7842.40] like this okay so our translation of the
[7846.32] qu and it has nothing like this because
[7848.64] it says then we created the seed to be a
[7851.92] then we created the clot to be a lump of
[7854.24] Flesh then we created bones in the lump
[7856.96] of Flesh no that's not what it says
[7859.12] that's false translation because it says
[7863.52] here it says
[7868.96] here we created the which is a
[7874.96] flesh we created the flesh into bones so
[7879.96] it literally it becomes that becomes
[7882.28] bones and then it says we clothe like a
[7886.28] jacket you know a jacket we clothe
[7890.36] the with
[7892.52] flesh so basically like a
[7896.36] jacket the bones get flesh around them
[7899.96] literally like a j you see and clothe
[7902.76] look brother and clothe the bones with
[7905.00] flesh so here this is another grammar
[7907.24] sorry another disaster where comes to
[7909.96] science and embryologist if you go to
[7912.40] school or university ask any
[7914.52] embryologist any any scientist ask him
[7917.56] do you believe when you are in the womb
[7919.12] of your at this stage do you think that
[7921.20] you are a bone you're nothing but bones
[7923.60] and then Allah clothed the bones with
[7926.00] flesh it's a mistake Brother come on yes
[7928.96] I see so our Im so if okay you said yes
[7932.52] you said yes I'm happy that you are
[7934.20] honest so why do you worship a God that
[7937.72] can make mistakes brother well first of
[7940.64] all you know that we have these imams
[7942.48] who are able to interpret and adjust the
[7944.72] Shar for the times so Allah needs Allah
[7947.64] Allah's words need interpretation
[7948.96] brother Allah is not clear enough here
[7951.52] the Arabic is
[7952.92] clear no Quran that we have today
[7955.80] brother the Arabic is very clear the
[7958.28] Arabic is
[7959.64] clear not a single verse in the Quran
[7961.92] that we have today is clear anymore
[7963.40] because what did your Scholars the the
[7965.20] tap that you gave me earlier okay what
[7967.92] is what does the tap say that you send
[7970.28] it to me that's it from the IMs so okay
[7974.68] can you send me uh for chapter
[7979.20] 2314 can you send me uh the PDF T please
[7982.72] so that we can go through it since we're
[7984.72] talking about the truth and the truth
[7986.68] like we agreed both together should set
[7989.24] us free send me the file too I just sent
[7992.12] it
[7994.36] yes yes let me open that one
[7999.16] too let's go to that
[8003.40] yeah all right
[8008.08] 23 verse 14 that's the verse that we're
[8010.84] looking
[8014.04] for
[8015.21] [Music]
[8016.80] okay
[8021.44] 232 what happened
[8023.68] to
[8027.64] 14 40 days it become you see again the
[8030.68] seed comes to comes to be in the womb
[8032.88] for 40 days do you see it then it
[8035.20] becomes a clot for 40 days which is
[8037.88] another disaster then it becomes a lump
[8040.64] for 40
[8042.28] days another
[8044.80] disaster so when the four months are
[8049.80] complete why did they leave out where
[8053.56] where wait what happened to the to the
[8056.52] flesh part and the bones where what
[8058.00] happened to it why are they not talking
[8059.44] about it why not know but as you know
[8062.84] because I did they did they skip
[8067.84] it wait wait wait
[8076.56] here
[8087.76] okay the whole bones skipped they did
[8090.28] not even dare to talk about it they
[8093.88] skipped it
[8096.32] okay if this is skipped so I believe you
[8099.72] know basic things about that we do not
[8102.00] believe the Quran is without the so if
[8104.48] there's no for this part of the verse
[8106.08] then we can't accept it yeah and even
[8108.16] here your translation brother look then
[8110.44] we clothe the bones with flesh do you
[8112.04] see so even your translation
[8113.93] [Music]
[8115.08] agrees yes it says um then we created
[8118.80] the then we clothed the bone with flesh
[8125.04] yeah
[8127.56] yeah that's what it
[8130.00] says I see and so if
[8133.04] the this is not the T this is the Ayah
[8135.76] so here we have the translation of the
[8137.28] Ayah so even your translation that
[8139.68] you're giving me agrees with me not with
[8142.68] you I see yes because again does the
[8146.52] mention the bones in the flesh no it
[8148.28] does not it says then we clothe bones
[8151.48] with flesh so if you have to believe
[8154.60] what this what it says again we go back
[8157.72] you have to believe that you look like
[8159.44] this okay well yes because the Ayah
[8162.12] mentions this but the doesn't because
[8164.52] the doesn't it's
[8166.56] not but brother did I create this
[8169.12] translation you gave it to me brother I
[8171.88] did yes because so do you agree with
[8174.16] this translation or not I do agree with
[8176.56] the translation okay then you have to
[8178.08] believe that you look like this
[8182.68] no I do not believe it I look that's
[8184.36] what it says brother they are literally
[8186.32] translating the Arabic yes but if the if
[8189.64] there's Quran and
[8191.96] it because this is not accompanied with
[8195.00] I don't take this part of the verse
[8197.08] as I see this is how this is how we take
[8199.96] the Quran if there's no from the IM we
[8202.12] do not take it
[8203.56] as okay so you don't take it as a h
[8207.00] because it's they forgot to do the for
[8209.40] it since there is say we do not take
[8212.16] this part as we only take the Quran with
[8214.52] the okay so they left it out they didn't
[8217.48] even care to give us the meaning for
[8221.52] it I'm I'm just factchecking if
[8227.80] they no they they don't even they don't
[8231.08] even talk about the at
[8233.68] all okay they it out okay but the Quran
[8238.08] what what they going to do with the
[8239.20] Quran
[8240.96] what about the Quran that it says
[8243.28] that theam are literally covered with
[8246.72] flesh yes this is not without the and
[8249.84] since the there's no for we cannot take
[8252.12] this part of the
[8253.52] verse okay so Allah's words are not
[8257.00] clear enough according to you Allah is
[8258.36] not clear enough no Allah was clear but
[8261.24] since there was a but is he clear or is
[8263.32] he not clear because on the other hand
[8264.88] you say he's clear but you need the
[8266.76] words of men to explain Allah's words
[8268.68] that are clear you said it's clear
[8271.80] so we have we have a problem here
[8273.32] brother brother all due respect we have
[8275.08] a problem here you say it's clear but
[8278.72] then it's not clear is it clear or it's
[8280.72] not clear it's one of the two the is
[8283.84] clear because the is and the is okay so
[8288.16] when Allah says that the bones are
[8289.84] covered with flesh is it
[8293.20] clear no not
[8296.36] without so it's clear but it's not clear
[8299.84] without t okay got it yes it's not clear
[8303.56] without but it's
[8305.92] clear only with yes but you said Allah's
[8310.24] words are clear the Quran is clear
[8312.76] because the Quran said in another Ayah
[8316.08] we explained everything in
[8319.32] details yes this was when the Quran was
[8322.32] revealed with because we believe that
[8324.68] when the Quran was revealed Allah sent
[8326.36] down with it due to and since the Quran
[8329.52] is it was the T was removed yeah so the
[8332.64] Quran is corrupted and and you said the
[8334.80] Quran is corrupted which chapters are
[8336.56] corrupted according to you asari there's
[8339.28] just different AAS in each chapters that
[8341.08] have been corrupted like I know how do
[8343.56] you find out that they are corrupted
[8345.28] what what what is your
[8348.40] authorative who do you take to to know

[8353.08] corrupted points out which it points out
[8356.00] which a have been okay got it got it
[8359.28] thank you yes it explains and it also
[8361.80] corrects how the verse should should be
[8363.52] recited like an example of a corrupted
[8365.76] verse is um Quran 940 or Quran
[8368.56] 333 these are examples of eyes which
[8371.04] have been corrupted yes I see I
[8377.24] see but we have a problem in chapter
[8381.48] 60 wait not 60
[8385.52] 116 so let's see if we go to the
[8389.28] Quran what was that a
[8392.52] again chapter six no chapter six sorry
[8395.44] not 66 six chapter six which I in
[8398.20] chapter six let's let's see which

[8430.84] your lord has been accomplished truly
[8432.48] and justly there is none who can change
[8433.88] his words he is the hearing the knowing
[8435.76] this verse is corrupted we see this is
[8438.48] not how it was revealed uh so this verse
[8440.76] is
[8441.92] corrupted yes it was revealed saying and
[8445.32] the Beautiful word of your lord has been
[8447.28] accomplished truly and justly that is
[8449.16] that's what it's supposed to say in that
[8450.76] you gave me earlier it says it's
[8452.32] corrupted yes can you send me the file
[8454.88] please so I want to read it yes if you
[8456.96] go to chapter six I sent the I sent the
[8460.20] T for chapter 6 you go to 115 it will
[8462.84] highlight how the verse was actually
[8464.32] revealed
[8467.24] wow
[8477.28] beautiful I have to go all the way down
[8479.96] okay
[8485.28] 115
[8486.72] [Music]
[8489.24] 120
[8495.64] okay oh you just passed it right here
[8499.40] right pass it no a little bit down no
[8501.96] you passed it
[8503.56] yeah where does it say it's it's say
[8506.36] scroll down a little bit mm U no other
[8509.84] other way
[8512.76] other way yeah keep going a little bit
[8515.44] you'll see where there's red highlight
[8516.96] right here
[8519.16] yes but what is the corruption in
[8521.28] according to you so it says um in the
[8524.92] Quran we have today you see the
[8526.68] highlighted that's how it was revealed
[8528.32] and the Beautiful word of your lord has
[8529.88] been accomplished truly and justly uhhuh
[8532.52] and may I be sacrificed for you but are
[8535.64] we are reciting it as and the word of
[8537.56] your lord has been accomplished truly
[8539.16] and justly but only that part is
[8541.80] corrupted no we only we believe that the
[8544.36] full verse because there were there was
[8546.00] different additions because it's the
[8547.44] true verse is and the word of your lord
[8549.48] has been accomplished truly and justly
[8551.28] oh yeah here referring to that's how we
[8553.20] recite it and this is how I recite the
[8555.32] Quran oh I
[8560.48] see but you just created another problem
[8564.20] because here in the bottom look and the
[8566.56] word of your lord has been accomplished
[8568.48] truly and justly there is
[8571.00] none who can change his words yes this
[8573.60] is the m version of the AY yes because
[8576.96] the one with the highlighted red is the
[8578.48] true Ayah I do not recite this version
[8581.52] of the Ayah in this highlighted this
[8583.48] this highlighted Ayah is this the
[8584.92] corruption or the actual Ayah according
[8587.00] to you this is the corrupted a right
[8590.48] here
[8592.36] uhhuh yes this is the corrupted a and I
[8594.80] do not recite this Ayah okay
[8598.12] wow okay interesting
[8610.48] interesting
[8612.60] interesting so what you have in your
[8614.64] hands is not the real Quran right
[8616.20] according to you it's yes and is it true
[8621.28] that when im Al Mahi comes he will give
[8623.72] you the correct uncorrupted Quran this
[8626.64] is
[8628.00] true I see
[8636.36] mhm because yes I'm being very clear
[8638.84] very honest many people will try to say
[8640.24] that the Quran is not corrupted well
[8642.04] it's we've proven that it is so does
[8644.52] your Quran have uh
[8647.28] similar uh amount of ay compared to the
[8651.16] H Quran or not no it has 11,000 missing
[8655.36] AAS around 11,000 right 11 to 12,000
[8659.28] yeah so you agree
[8661.00] you agree with theith in where it says
[8663.24] that originally it was
[8665.68] 17,000 yes 17,000
[8669.04] correct let's see if we can pull up that
[8672.32] Hadith yes we do accept thisth it's even
[8675.36] for so a but uh the 12 sh do not agree
[8680.88] with you right about that theis are
[8685.00] twers but not all of them are all 12 ver
[8688.68] no um all all are 12 it's like Oriental
[8692.36] and Eastern Orthodox think of it that
[8693.92] way so according to all 12 believe that
[8697.96] the Quran is no only the okay the okay
[8702.24] so okay so here is the yeah here is the
[8705.96] same book that we read earlier Volume
[8708.52] Two by
[8710.84] Alani uh volume two page
[8715.36] 634
[8717.40] inran the Quran the
[8720.88] gave to
[8722.40] Muhammad
[8724.60] s
[8729.88] wasam so originally the Quran that was
[8732.72] given to from jel to Muhammad by J to
[8735.44] Muhammad was 770,000 ayy right
[8740.44] 17,000 verses so let me typ it out for
[8743.60] the people 17 0 originally that's the
[8748.16] amount of ayas in total
[8750.76] so if
[8752.36] we do the following calculation
[8755.84] okay the Quran of today and we talk
[8758.76] about the HS specifically the Quran
[8762.04] contains how many verses
[8764.32] 6, 236 I think yeah okay so if I take my
[8768.84] calculator just to give the audience an
[8771.64] idea so
[8773.72] 177,000 1 170 0 - 6 2 3
[8783.28] six around 10,000 actually
[8787.28] specifically
[8789.52] 10,764 missing
[8792.00] ayas what happened to those ayas that
[8795.12] are missing now they were moved or lost
[8798.08] who who Could That who who who made that
[8802.08] happen yes so wait
[8806.44] whenb destroyed the qurans and burned
[8809.20] them to the ground he removed he did not
[8811.88] only barbecued the original
[8814.44] manuscripts but he also got rid of
[8818.28] 10,764 hours
[8821.20] correct yes he
[8824.36] did can we clearly say
[8827.12] thatman was
[8829.52] a CF kaf yeah he was for burning and
[8835.20] destroying Allah's Quran yes may Allah
[8838.48] curse him yeah
[8842.16] right yes
[8845.68] unbelievable what's
[8847.40] unbelievable
[8849.32] that we have this This Disaster you know
[8853.08] this is a disaster brother don't you see
[8854.68] the disaster that Allah allowed someone
[8858.12] lik to not only burn the original qurans
[8861.92] they don't exist anymore but he even
[8863.92] allowed to remove
[8866.80] 10,000
[8868.68] 10,764 eyes
[8872.16] how can Allah allow that to
[8873.80] happen because we have free
[8878.76] will Allah gave us Free Will and with
[8881.60] our free will we corrupted the
[8885.48] book I
[8888.12] see yeah uh if I can put the translation
[8891.72] people are maybe asking for the
[8893.20] translation here's the translation
[8895.92] guys this is alfi volume 2 book 3
[8899.32] chapter 14 Hadith number 28 and of
[8902.68] course the Hadith
[8905.48] is so it's uh agreed on yes it is the
[8910.76] Quran that jiel brought to Muhammad had
[8914.12] 177,000
[8916.04] verses
[8918.72] correct this is Shia Hadith guys don't
[8921.36] confuse it with the sun Hadith
[8923.32] please yes there you
[8927.24] go but then also I can prove that in
[8930.52] Sunni books AB he told the people if
[8933.20] there's anything in the Quran missing
[8934.76] just replace it with poetry yes I have
[8937.40] the it's yes but um you said free will
[8943.04] which you have a Hadith or something for
[8945.60] me an authentic Hadith or something
[8947.84] maybe from alfi which says that you have
[8950.08] free will a sh Muslim yes we do not
[8953.12] believe in predestination like the sun
[8954.92] do we do have Hadith about it where can
[8957.08] I find such a Hadith it's in Alf I can
[8959.88] find it okay can you can you send it to
[8962.48] me if you it yes I can go find it
[8965.36] because I I do believe sunn believe in
[8967.20] predestination but we do believe in free
[8969.32] yeah sunnis believe even that Allah they
[8971.80] make Allah look like a clown and they
[8973.56] believe that Allah fixed even adultery
[8975.48] on
[8976.24] them it's it's a joke yeah we do not
[8978.84] believe this whatsoever so okay
[8985.28] interesting Even Adam is refuting Moses
[8988.12] in Sunni Islam saying that U
[8992.08] Adam says that Allah wrote on him a
[8995.24] sin 40 days before his creation it's in
[8998.88] in in in the Sunni books if I'm not
[9002.08] mistaken it's in
[9004.88] bukari yes I believe so yeah in Sun
[9009.36] Islam Allah loves you to sin
[9020.68] okay I found it it's
[9022.44] in so book three chapter 78 sermon 78
[9028.36] can you drop the link for me please yes
[9030.92] thank you it's from the same website
[9033.92] beautiful so IM Ali said Allah the
[9037.48] glorified has ordered people to act by
[9039.68] Free Will and has cautioned them and
[9041.56] refrain from Evil basically so he's
[9044.48] saying that IM Ali is saying where's
[9046.56] that part just sorry where forgive me
[9048.60] where's that part
[9050.52] um here okay Allah the glorified has
[9053.64] ordered his people to act by free will
[9056.04] oh I see
[9057.12] it and I scorion them and refrain them
[9060.48] from
[9062.56] Evil I see
[9066.24] yes yes because even like even the the
[9071.32] they believe that their sins were
[9072.80] predestined and they are still going to
[9074.24] be punished for it however this is not
[9076.00] the case then that would mean Allah is
[9077.28] an unjust
[9078.48] God I see
[9091.12] if we use
[9092.24] logic if God has already predestined our
[9095.08] sins and we will be punished for
[9096.84] something that we had no choice in then
[9098.56] that would mean God is unjust so even
[9100.60] just using
[9106.52] logic well the the Arabic doesn't say
[9109.32] what the English says
[9110.72] though what do you
[9113.60] mean
[9115.96] like
[9118.32] what's it doesn't talk about Free Will
[9120.96] at
[9122.36] all what does it talk
[9124.88] about it says just he gave
[9127.96] him to
[9130.04] choose you can you could interpret it as
[9132.72] free will though does it say t with it
[9136.48] it says that they can choose
[9140.60] doesn't talk about Free Will at all
[9143.52] that's not what the Arabic
[9146.12] says okay this is added this part is
[9149.92] added brother this yellow here what I
[9151.96] just
[9153.04] highlighted this is added extra it's it
[9156.04] only says that they can
[9158.36] choose it says it says in Arabic Allah
[9164.04] Allah the most high or to be glorified
[9167.00] let's say Subhan Allah in Allah subhah
[9172.16] glory to
[9174.08] Allah he
[9177.60] commanded his servants or his
[9179.96] worshippers let's say his
[9183.48] slaves in
[9188.32] choosing I see not free will so you can
[9192.44] choose there is a huge difference when I
[9194.48] say choosing something I can choose you
[9197.32] know a car you know I like a BMW more
[9200.00] than uh a BMW uh Mercedes right Benz Or
[9204.72] maybe I like
[9206.76] uh if I watch Rula one I like you
[9211.96] know uh to support
[9217.36] uh let's say uh that team over the other
[9221.84] team but it's not talking about free
[9224.12] will this is
[9225.32] literally faulty translation I can
[9228.48] choose I I can choose but it's not
[9231.00] talking about fuel at all yeah so I
[9233.36] found another he then if this was not
[9234.96] clear this one is very clear that says
[9237.16] that we were that us Shia we reject
[9238.96] predestination as found in this I just
[9240.92] sent to
[9242.68] you just a second okay just a second
[9245.96] okay no problem
[9272.64] I had something uh someone at the door
[9274.52] forgive me that's
[9276.76] okay all right okay if what what Hadith
[9280.40] can you send it to me so we can read it
[9282.08] yes I can send it again yes this one
[9284.52] it's towards the middle of the Hadi okay
[9299.96] y i i see all the time I see zurara is
[9302.92] not zurara uh Zur is one of one of the
[9307.12] greatest companions he's basically like
[9309.00] the he's basically our version of Peter
[9311.28] too
[9312.48] IM but Zara is he not criticized by your
[9316.56] own
[9317.92] Shia scholar
[9320.44] that was during tap but he's he's they
[9323.60] called him a liar didn't they that was
[9325.92] dur that was during tap because we know
[9327.72] Zur was truthful he's praised by the Im
[9329.60] so so what do you mean
[9332.40] doing well they they said Zur was a liar
[9335.72] and disassociated from them out out of
[9337.84] Tak so they wouldn't be
[9340.24] killed because Zur was one of the main
[9342.88] figures of Shia
[9345.16] Islam I know I know he's one of the four
[9348.28] right one of the the the four what four
[9351.20] Scholars who are basically reporting
[9353.32] Hadith one of the main four sort of yeah
[9356.48] he was one of the close Companions of
[9357.92] the yes yeah but he's called a liar you
[9361.64] you agree no he not a liar he was um
[9364.36] they called him a liar out of Tak so
[9366.28] they did not they they called him a liar
[9368.72] but no he was not because he was praised
[9370.04] by theam he's a truthful person
[9372.76] basically one second where's the where's
[9375.96] the part where it says okay no problem
[9377.68] where's where's the part where it says
[9379.32] uh free
[9381.12] Willer in this
[9385.88] Hadith I don't see
[9389.64] it why after you ni okay I'm back so um
[9394.96] where do where's talking about the free
[9396.52] will then um you see others believe in
[9399.24] predestination which we similar
[9400.76] disassociate from it you
[9403.96] see it's talking about the that we do
[9406.48] not believe in predestination so the
[9408.52] opposite of predestination is Free
[9414.36] Will oh I see here this part
[9418.24] okay
[9422.64] okay all this believe and predestination
[9425.20] which we seem dissociate from is it's
[9427.76] not of the religion of your forefathers
[9430.48] okay
[9432.40] interesting all
[9434.36] right yeah you see I'm uh I'm learning
[9437.36] uh started learning about sh Islam for
[9440.24] the last couple of years but going to be
[9442.84] honest with you I'm still learning much
[9444.36] about Shia Islam I know a lot about it
[9447.32] but uh it's not like uh my knowledge
[9451.52] about Sunni
[9453.08] Islam I see because yeah it's much
[9455.12] easier to refute the sunnes you know why
[9457.28] because um to be honest with you uh just
[9463.00] the recent couple of years that I have
[9465.00] access finally to sh books because it's
[9467.24] really hard for for us to find Shia
[9470.72] books but I'm I'm slowly getting in
[9474.04] there what do you think about the
[9475.60] following Hadith that I
[9477.08] found
[9478.84] in about this one I found a very
[9481.44] interesting Hadith that I want to talk
[9483.92] about since you said you believe that
[9486.84] alfi is authentic right you said it's
[9489.96] completely
[9490.96] authentic I found this interesting
[9493.80] Hadith
[9495.36] in volume one same okay page
[9502.04] 284 volume 1 page 284 we go
[9505.68] down it says when Muhammad was
[9515.52] born there was no milk for him and then
[9520.72] it says Abu Talib the uncle of Muhammad
[9523.88] put him on his breasts and then Allah
[9526.32] sent down milk from the breast of Abu
[9531.56] Talib so Muhammad is literally
[9534.36] breastfeeding as a baby from his uncle's
[9537.04] um
[9540.64] verticles I see so do you have a problem
[9543.60] with this or not and this one yes
[9545.52] there's a scribal error because we know
[9547.56] we have other we have another narration
[9549.20] where it mentions that scal error it
[9552.72] was yeah you said moments
[9556.00] ago fully AC reports are authentic yeah
[9558.92] but there could be some words that are
[9560.16] off yeah so we know it was the not
[9564.24] a I can send I can send in the chat
[9567.56] right
[9568.68] here Al so another man according to you
[9572.04] it was the was a was a slave girl ah a
[9575.20] slave girl so we have a corruption
[9578.40] within but you say it's authentic well I
[9581.24] believe there are scrib erors like I
[9582.68] believe that the meton has can have some
[9584.48] scribal errors through analysis yeah
[9586.36] okay so what you're saying is uh the
[9588.48] Hadith is authentic
[9590.84] the Hadith yeah but it just um but it
[9593.24] contains a scribal
[9595.08] error yes I believe that there can be
[9597.20] scribal errors
[9599.36] yeah okay so we have a
[9603.00] corruption inside an authentic Hadith in
[9605.96] the metan in the text in the Met yeah in
[9608.44] the Met yeah the Senate is all authentic
[9611.20] though
[9613.28] okay interesting according to because I
[9617.20] did I did not find it in he's saying
[9620.88] it's by um S I
[9624.28] believe
[9628.36] okay I'm taking
[9630.96] notes yeah first it was Thea then Halima
[9634.60] so no it just not mention
[9637.32] Thea Hala is the one who breasted him
[9640.56] the then after yes sorry who first it
[9645.28] was Thea and then har Thea
[9649.40] okay
[9651.96] yes corruption in the in the text okay
[9655.04] in the metan yeah the Met yeah okay
[9662.32] interesting interesting because there's
[9665.68] no foot Noe that explains that you know
[9668.96] normally you have foot noes here but
[9670.68] there is noot like I know meny does
[9672.48] explain a lot but he doesn't get
[9674.00] everything every single thing I'm not I
[9676.24] don't think meny was aware of the
[9677.64] scribal error though
[9680.16] Al mag didn't know about
[9682.12] it the same guy who who who did the
[9685.12] grading right I'm not sure if magy was
[9687.92] aware of it so well I'm not sure if he
[9690.92] was
[9692.36] so
[9706.72] okay okay
[9711.36] I have
[9712.48] um I have an issue with one thing though
[9717.40] yes uh I found a
[9722.48] Hadith
[9724.56] that's one of Allah's names is um it's
[9728.84] it's kind of disturbing to be honest
[9730.12] with you if I would be Shia I would
[9732.52] reconsider in worshiping Allah here's a
[9736.16] book called in you know this website
[9738.00] Shia Online Library
[9739.72] I do yes this is the book
[9743.32] called by that you mentioned
[9747.00] earlier he he's he's he's a good guy
[9749.92] right in
[9752.00] shlam is he among the 12
[9755.72] imams no he's not among the 12s now he's
[9758.56] not right okay no he's a scholar scholar
[9763.16] okay uh on page 290 219 219 it says that
[9769.20] one of the names of
[9771.72] Allah
[9773.32] look
[9774.92] okay
[9777.64] is so said
[9781.16] this this is said by Abu
[9785.76] abdah the father of
[9788.40] abdah says it
[9791.44] not just included this
[9794.52] Hadith one of the name so if I copy it
[9797.12] copy so that the people
[9799.80] sure no problem so if I put the
[9804.32] translation ah is one of the names of
[9807.84] Allah sure here's the link but could I
[9810.76] see the link though yeah yeah I will
[9812.24] send it I'm not sure if I need to
[9814.48] shorten it because it contains Arabic
[9817.44] words in the link so let me make it
[9819.44] smaller a little
[9820.80] bit give me a second tiny
[9823.95] [Music]
[9827.16] URL else it's uh won't
[9831.64] work
[9835.56] nice website is
[9837.80] down tiny or okay let's let me see if
[9841.40] Discord accepts it though it's a long oh
[9844.96] okay it does
[9849.40] okay let me
[9853.80] see
[9855.36] okay for the people also in on YouTube
[9858.28] here is the
[9860.12] one of of the names of Allah
[9871.72] is so I believe it's and right
[9878.72] yeah no that no that's
[9883.48] um so it's yeah yeah another words if
[9889.44] you read
[9894.04] it so the
[9897.44] narrator let's see imagine if someone
[9899.96] says Ah that's Allah's name and the
[9902.60] authority of his father who said okay so
[9905.72] first of all we see in the in the Senate
[9908.44] we have an unknown person where it says
[9910.20] on the authority of his father who said
[9912.24] usually when they when it says on the
[9913.56] authority of his father it says the name
[9915.88] so we have an unknown narrator so out of
[9918.60] I would I wouldn't be able to accept the
[9919.92] suit to the unknown Nar so because we
[9921.76] have the his father name is not
[9923.64] mentioned that only that because of that
[9926.40] no there's an unknown narrator so I
[9927.80] would have to be very careful about
[9929.20] where where where is the unknown it says
[9932.24] um
[9934.56] or told
[9936.56] me his father abdah who is our
[9942.20] sixth let me see what said
[9946.16] about let me see real quick
[9965.60] anyway interesting stuff though I'm I'm
[9968.68] interested in Shia Islam you know to
[9970.24] learn more about Shia Islam to be honest
[9972.08] with you because um it it just happened
[9975.36] recently that the website that we have
[9977.48] been using earlier that is finally uh
[9980.24] available for us you
[9982.24] know on in its entirety is now
[9987.52] online I
[9991.96] see I'm happy though that the SH now
[9994.52] like the sunnis they are translating
[9996.24] their
[9997.44] Hadith yes we do you see I don't need
[10001.48] any translation to be honest honest with
[10003.64] you but you know it it makes someone's
[10005.76] life much easier
[10020.80] okay have you ever heard about shoe
[10023.00] colors in
[10024.16] Shon yes the the black and yellow yeah
[10027.92] you think about that what about that
[10030.64] it's not a big deal for me because I
[10031.88] don't wear black or yellow
[10035.48] shoes yeah but it is in though
[10039.56] I know yes but it's not of significant
[10041.76] importance to me because I wear blue
[10043.00] shoes so do you have do you have but
[10047.00] it's no that's not what Hadith say it
[10048.80] says I know because this you have to
[10050.88] wear yellow shoes it doesn't say you
[10053.24] have to it's recommended we believe it's
[10054.88] supposed to have wear the yellow shoes
[10060.08] yeah yeah but it's not saying you have
[10062.28] to wear it says where the yellow well if
[10064.16] if if I'm getting the advice that my
[10066.08] penis will not stop or will it will stop
[10068.56] working
[10069.52] working I'm I will make sure that I only
[10072.00] have yellow shoes not black shoes not
[10074.52] green shoes not blue shoes I don't think
[10077.76] the the Hadith says penis I thought I
[10079.56] think it says prowess like
[10083.48] strength make sure penis
[10087.20] heart well if it doesn't I would be
[10089.08] wearing yellow
[10091.64] shoes have you ever wear other color
[10094.20] shoes
[10095.32] before um no I don't think so I don't
[10098.32] think I wear black or yellow shoes not
[10101.28] yellow shoes I don't I don't have yellow
[10105.92] shoes sorry you know it's it's kind of
[10108.56] cringy though to you know to ask but
[10111.04] have you ever had problems then if you
[10113.60] don't wear yellow
[10115.12] shoes no I have
[10122.64] not well you don't get penis problems
[10125.24] for not wearing yellow
[10127.44] shoes that's not what happens yes it
[10130.76] does look it says here if you wear black
[10132.72] shoes
[10134.00] look okay if you wear a black
[10137.44] shoe it will give
[10142.16] you your penis will not work okay well I
[10146.12] don't wear black shoes
[10148.32] so so if you wear black shoes it loses
[10152.08] your penis and give you depression and
[10155.24] you will lose your eyesight can you send
[10157.52] me the the link on for this
[10160.68] one I have to I have to look it up if I
[10164.20] have it I'll will send it in eventually
[10166.40] in the chat no problem I don't have it
[10169.64] right now but I found this one very very
[10173.44] long time seen before yeah but I don't
[10176.00] believe it mentioned the penis I thought
[10177.36] it mentioned like strength and prowess
[10179.04] so yeah was strong of the
[10180.56] penis I
[10186.20] see interesting
[10189.68] do you know how dog is created in in
[10192.20] Shia Islam No I do not know
[10195.68] how if we go
[10197.80] toar by
[10199.60] IM it says that be careful
[10202.76] about why
[10205.16] okay it's it's a Shia book but it
[10207.96] contains nonth in it so be very cautious
[10211.48] when using it how can we find out if
[10213.36] that it you know it's got things mixed
[10215.96] up we have to look at this the set
[10219.68] this one does agree with sun Islam
[10222.44] though it says that a dog is created it
[10226.52] says the dog is
[10228.24] created yeah yes it says that a dog is
[10231.12] Created from the spit of
[10233.20] Satan here okay there's nothing
[10235.68] inherently wrong with this Hadith but is
[10237.36] it also mentioned by Sunni Hadith as
[10239.16] well yes okay then we throw it
[10242.40] out our told us to throw out any Hadith
[10245.44] that's similar to Sun ones so it's is it
[10249.08] is possible that the meaning is that the
[10250.92] origin or the creation of a dog is from
[10254.08] Jin and specifically from the
[10257.08] saliva of Satan so inherently there's
[10260.84] nothing wrong with this Hadith but
[10262.28] because it's um because it can be
[10263.76] related to Sun had as well we don't we I
[10266.72] don't I don't think that it says that
[10268.20] where does it say that no because if
[10270.48] there's aith with a similar met then
[10273.04] yeah we would or especially similar
[10275.20] Senate that that would be a very large
[10277.56] cause for concern but but that's not
[10279.12] what it says here you're you're you're
[10281.76] you're doing an assumption of yes but
[10284.68] didn't you say that the there's also Sun
[10286.76] yeah it's a little bit different it's in
[10288.40] the Sunni books it says that uh Adam was
[10292.32] created by Allah and he was a statue for
[10296.00] 40 long years Allah did not finish
[10299.72] creating Adam and he waited for 40 years
[10303.28] then the Sunni books say that and this
[10306.08] is the tap for the Quran by the way so
[10308.36] this an Ayah and you know it talks how
[10311.40] Allah first sends an angel that angel uh
[10315.12] fails and
[10317.36] stealing uh let's say um dirt from the
[10320.24] earth the earth
[10321.92] says and he rejects that angel and the
[10324.48] angel goes back and then then another
[10326.12] Angel is sent so we have Michael we have
[10328.96] giel and then finally the third Angel
[10332.36] the angel of death is sent and then he
[10334.76] he succeeds by stealing some dirt and
[10338.36] from from the dirt Adam is
[10340.40] created So Adam is created and he's a
[10343.04] statue for 40 years Satan sees the
[10346.28] statue meaning Adam that is not fully
[10349.32] created yet and he's Hollow so Satan
[10352.44] goes inside the mouth of Adam and he
[10357.12] comes out of his
[10359.32] anus sorry to say but that's what the
[10361.84] Yeah that's what the Sunni says so he he
[10364.80] goes inside his mouth he comes out of
[10367.12] his bum and then he spits on the belly
[10371.04] of Adam so Adam is still a statue right
[10374.96] and then Jil comes he dugs out that spit
[10378.04] and because of he dugs out that spit the
[10380.68] belly button is created and from that
[10383.12] belly button a dog is created
[10386.76] so okay so due to it being a similar
[10389.40] method with sunnes out of ifat I would
[10391.24] not accept this narration because we
[10393.04] reject them at least have similar me to
[10396.00] interesting interesting
[10401.72] I would say to a Sunni do not insult
[10403.68] dogs because dogs are your brothers in
[10407.28] Islam because literally from
[10411.68] the human nature from Adam himself dogs
[10415.48] are created so whenever you see a Sunni
[10417.44] Muslim tell him be
[10420.48] careful dogs are your brothers in
[10424.80] Islam that's literally what it it says
[10427.52] guys let me actually put it up let me
[10430.40] put it up before Sunni Muslims say Rob
[10432.92] you're
[10434.60] lying uh creation of
[10439.24] Adam
[10441.84] look creation of this is T for chapter
[10446.48] 2 ay
[10448.64] 31 so Satan passed him meaning Adam and
[10451.52] at that time guys I said Adam is a
[10454.44] stone statue he very tall okay
[10459.12] then he struck him with his hand who did
[10460.88] that Satan passed by Adam then struck
[10462.88] him with his hand and Adam was Hollow so
[10465.32] he Satan entered him Adam and he came
[10467.68] out of his
[10469.24] anus so he he went inside maybe his
[10472.04] mouth let's say like this this is Adam
[10475.32] in his Sun Islam he goes inside his
[10478.32] either maybe his mouth or ear whatever
[10481.12] and he goes out of his bum out of his
[10486.72] anus and Satan CED some spit from his
[10489.56] mouth so he did Haku
[10494.44] okay he did a hak
[10499.16] to and that spit landed on the belly
[10501.64] button of Adam you see it this is
[10503.88] ridiculous so Allah commanded jel to
[10506.44] wipe off the spit of the cursed one
[10508.28] meaning shitan from Adam's belly and
[10511.36] because of that action of jel the belly
[10513.52] button was dug so jel
[10517.32] did after the hak two of Shan and that's
[10521.84] how the belly button was created then
[10523.72] Allah himself created from that hole of
[10526.88] the belly button a
[10529.56] dog imagine so if we put if we put it
[10533.16] you know in an illustration that's how a
[10535.60] dog is created so if I would be a Sunni
[10537.84] Muslim I would never ever call someone a
[10541.20] dog to be honest
[10543.84] with because dogs in Sunni Islam are
[10546.68] your brothers
[10548.60] and I think that's where originally the
[10550.44] Haku comes from exactly someone is
[10552.44] saying Satan did the original
[10556.00] Haku this is ridiculous yeah but then
[10559.12] also if the dog is black you have to
[10560.68] kill it according to sise yes that's
[10563.16] even more problematic but no in Sunni
[10566.08] Islam brother
[10567.96] um in Sunni Islam Allah has a
[10572.12] dog that that's ridiculous yeah cuz I
[10575.00] Allah is literally a dog that's again a
[10577.84] for the
[10579.36] should let me find it yeah when I first
[10582.20] converted to Islam I was Sunni but I
[10583.88] didn't know all of this when as soon as
[10585.36] I found out about this then yeah I just
[10587.08] left did you know about Allah having a
[10589.16] dog no I did not know that
[10591.92] no actually let me let me pull it up
[10594.84] literally in Sunni Islam I'm not sure
[10596.72] about Shia I need to find it if there's
[10599.20] something like that not sure I did not
[10600.96] find it yet if we go to the most
[10608.40] or the oldest actually
[10611.96] look let me put it in the chat as
[10616.04] well and let me put it also in Discord
[10618.80] so that everybody can collect
[10621.32] it look what it
[10625.64] says someone is saying I do te on Allah
[10630.64] I do not believe in Allah someone is
[10632.36] saying
[10635.24] look no here sorry
[10642.44] so this is the son of ABAB
[10645.48] himself or
[10647.72] sorry forgive
[10650.08] me
[10654.20] said I am doing kufur I disbelieve in
[10658.40] The Lord of the Nim who is the lord of
[10660.16] the Nim Allah
[10662.92] right this is for chapter 53 Ayah 1 by
[10665.80] the way
[10666.76] guys chapter 53y 1 by
[10670.48] IM all the way up
[10677.48] look
[10684.48] okay said
[10693.56] said so if we copy this part
[10700.84] copy Google
[10707.76] translate said I disbelieve in The Lord
[10710.56] of the star meaning Allah I am doing
[10713.64] kufur okay the messenger of Allah
[10716.04] meaning Muhammad said are you not afraid
[10719.72] that the dog of Allah will eat
[10722.48] you
[10724.32] mashallah that is that is ridiculous
[10729.44] unbelievable Allah has a dog and Allah's
[10732.20] dog according to Muhammad will eat
[10736.68] you Allah's dog will eat you what do you
[10739.36] think is this kufur well yeah of
[10742.56] course Allah has a can answer yeah sure
[10746.72] go
[10748.72] ahead all right so as we know IM he
[10753.28] himself he himself is the only one that
[10755.48] makes those claims and plus the thing is
[10758.16] that he made the claims again so
[10761.88] question my question to you is when will
[10763.64] you make claims that are not from
[10766.04] the wait so so Muhammad here is being
[10771.36] you know IM is forcing words in Allah's
[10774.84] or the messenger his mouth is that what
[10777.44] you're saying can you can you show me
[10780.36] one scholar from from the Sal yes that
[10784.04] agree upon imari that believe that Allah
[10787.72] has
[10789.60] what did he
[10791.80] what me one scholar show me one scholar
[10795.04] of the salafi that believe that Allah
[10798.00] subhana tal is a dog not Allah is a dog
[10801.36] Allah has a
[10803.12] dog why you corrup yes that was that's
[10805.52] what I said no that's not what you said
[10808.04] yeah that is not what you said maybe I'm
[10809.44] lagging I don't know that's what I said
[10812.28] what do you mean no you said that Allah
[10814.72] is a dog no no no no you see you came up
[10817.76] top
[10818.80] this is the problem of most Sunni
[10820.52] Muslims I have to give you you see the
[10822.04] Shia I've been talking for the last hour
[10824.48] with our Shia friend here and I like him
[10827.20] he's he's very respectful and I'm having
[10829.52] a wonderful conversation with him you
[10831.00] see I'm not here to fight anybody but
[10833.16] when you Sunni come up you are not only
[10835.64] forcing words in the mouth of
[10837.92] imari in
[10839.64] his and these are not the words of IMI
[10842.40] these are the words of
[10846.16] Allah all Allah rol the messenger is
[10849.68] talking not
[10852.92] imabari yeah my my you forc just a
[10857.28] second brother I'm not done you are
[10860.28] forcing words in the mouth of your
[10862.48] Prophet your Sunni Prophet which he did
[10864.44] not say he did not call Allah a dog he
[10867.40] said are you not afraid that Allah's dog
[10871.16] will eat you there's a difference you
[10873.72] said that the prophet said Allah is a
[10876.28] dog that's not what your Prophet said so
[10879.08] why did you do that
[10881.60] brother all right so if I said that
[10883.68] Allah is a I don't know what happened
[10886.28] with my mic or something but I meant uh
[10888.56] Al your mic made a
[10890.04] mistake just second your mic made no no
[10893.48] like like we like we debated past time
[10895.76] like we Deb should we do on your mic now
[10899.44] brother so your mic made right your
[10902.80] microphone is I don't think mic is in as
[10905.92] a person but uh even IM is the only one
[10911.16] that agrees upon this Hadith let me say
[10912.92] like
[10913.80] that is the only one show where can you
[10917.72] wa somebody's calling me can you show me
[10919.96] somebody that um somebody show us that
[10923.44] show us what show us what you said is
[10925.24] true show
[10927.88] us where does it say
[10931.72] that what show me where it says what you
[10935.24] says you're stating you're stating the
[10938.72] from I'm asking you if you can show me
[10942.52] where uh if you can show me if there is
[10944.84] a salaf if there's a Sal scholar or a
[10949.24] that is agreeing upon this and uh
[10953.20] that look it
[10963.40] says so we have even a chain of
[10965.52] narration and then it says
[10969.72] so we have a chain of narration here IM

[11005.64] Allah will eat
[11009.28] you so where's the
[11014.16] problem the guy that is uh what are the

[11046.60] static mic of yours is literally killing
[11049.64] our
[11055.76] ears you see guys he's throwing imabari
[11058.88] on the bus ask any Sunni scholar any
[11062.64] Imam who is the best what is the best in
[11066.60] Islam they will tell you
[11068.32] imari why because he's the most closest
[11073.36] one it's literally called
[11076.04] the ask Muhammad hijab Muhammad hijab in
[11079.16] a video said the best
[11083.44] isari the salais also will agree that
[11086.32] the best isari
[11088.24] because the rest of the MU or mu take
[11091.56] from
[11094.88] IM ibraim what do you think about this
[11097.28] Sunni after what you just heard you were
[11100.20] you were a Sunni before what do you
[11101.72] think about this damage control this
[11104.24] otherwi we call this
[11106.60] fixing so yeah when I first converted to
[11109.20] Islam I was Sunni but if I saw stuff
[11110.84] like this I would have never became
[11111.80] Sunni in the first
[11113.96] place yeah this is these are this is
[11116.12] ridiculous and also the Sunni who just
[11117.48] came on stage I don't think he has any
[11119.12] idea what he's talking about he has no
[11120.48] idea no he has no idea yeah simple he's
[11123.80] a kid you hear you hear it from his
[11125.52] voice she's a very I heard it yeah
[11127.52] that's true you know this is
[11131.84] problematic problematic on the other
[11134.84] hand in Sunni Islam dogs should be taken
[11137.32] care of except the guardian dogs you
[11139.08] know you have dogs that you know maybe
[11141.24] you use as a to guard your sheep or
[11144.60] whatnot but you are not allowed to keep
[11146.80] a dog as AET pet let's say or whatever
[11149.24] yeah uhhuh but then we see
[11151.56] Allah becoming a
[11154.04] hypocrite Muhammad making Allah look
[11156.20] like a hypocrite saying that Allah has a
[11158.64] dog and not only a dog but this dog is
[11161.20] very evil he will eat
[11166.32] you you know what is even more funnier
[11168.80] you know when they they try to explain
[11172.44] it you know what they said bro they said
[11175.08] Allah's dog is a a lion
[11179.36] Allah's dog Allah's dog became a lion
[11182.80] you know just to to do damage control
[11185.88] the scholar said you know it's not a dog
[11188.92] it's a lion so it is a dog but it's not
[11192.20] a dog it's a lion that's what they
[11194.64] said hello yeah yeah I see right I'm
[11198.68] back

[11258.00] question I don't have much time left but
[11260.56] I have a
[11261.60] question uh someone told me someone told
[11264.88] me a Sunni Muslim told me that Allah
[11268.08] brother a Allah is a young boy without a
[11273.52] beard there's actually an opinion on
[11276.36] this there was a
[11278.64] of saying the one who says that Muhammad
[11282.32] s wasallam saw Allah subhana and his
[11286.76] dream is a liar so would she say that is
[11290.64] a a higher source than the guy that
[11293.48] narrated that Muhammad s alhi wasallam
[11295.40] saw Allah subhana wa tala his dream but
[11299.92] that's one no no no it's notah yeah it
[11303.16] is the scholar SCH no no no no
[11306.68] no you are
[11308.60] Sala first of all theith is and second
[11313.84] in the explanation for that Hadith that
[11315.92] you're mentioning it says that she did
[11317.52] not hear it directly from Muhammad it's
[11320.28] her
[11322.28] assumption did you know that sure all
[11324.40] right show me theth and we'll see if
[11326.44] this sure no problem we can your mother
[11329.92] AA made a mistake and she gave her own
[11333.08] interpretation for the Ayah without
[11335.76] hearing it directly like AB so you need
[11338.84] to take notes brother are you taking
[11340.88] notes so you can fact check so no no
[11344.00] just a second just a second just a
[11345.76] second brother okay step by step because
[11349.04] we are talking about the truth and only
[11350.48] the truth will set everybody free
[11353.24] right this is why the brother the Shia
[11356.36] brother he who was once a Sunni that's
[11358.52] why one of the reasons why he left Islam
[11360.20] by the way are you saying Shia is oh you
[11363.16] saying he's not Muslim he's a Shia
[11365.24] Muslim now he was a Sunni like you he he
[11367.32] said he left Islam yeah he left Sunni
[11369.64] Islam he became Shia look here is the
[11371.92] book take a screenshot so you can can
[11374.96] fact check me later
[11377.44] okay okay and if we open this book of
[11381.56] right you know who is because you're
[11383.28] salafi Muslim you should know him he's
[11384.96] the teacher of I cath s
[11388.96] and also the teacher of uh people
[11393.12] like and many others right I know go on
[11396.08] go on okay in this book just stop
[11399.08] talking brother so we can we can pull it
[11400.92] up brother I don't like to be
[11402.00] interrupted to be honest you know that
[11403.96] when I read something I don't want you
[11405.36] to interrupt me I look on page 290 so
[11410.96] volume seven of This Book of Tamia's
[11413.48] book page
[11415.64] 290 okay
[11418.00] look Abbas is asked who is IB Abbas
[11423.72] brother he's the cousin of your
[11429.84] Prophet the translator of the Quran the
[11432.16] cousin of Muhammad and the scholar of
[11434.84] the um himself he's
[11438.96] asked did Muhammad see Allah question
[11445.12] mark he said yes
[11449.28] how did Allah how did Muhammad see
[11453.44] Allah he saw him in the image of a Young
[11456.20] Man without his hij without his uh his
[11460.16] without his Veil and the veil of Allah
[11462.60] is from meaning
[11465.56] from pearls and then like like you like
[11470.76] you he
[11472.20] said I said to AB
[11480.76] that nobody can see Allah
[11483.52] in
[11485.16] 103 are you agreeing with with what is
[11487.68] going on for now
[11490.48] continue now here's Abbas
[11493.52] reaction like you is specifically like
[11496.24] you so the question is specifically like
[11498.44] you nobody can see Allah in according to
[11501.48] the Quran in chapter 6y 103
[11507.80] you have no mother who is saying that I
[11510.60] Abbas is saying just like someone like
[11513.72] you brother with all due respect to you
[11516.04] you have no mother he's insulting him
[11519.20] he's basically calling him what a
[11522.04] bastard and by the way guys Tik Tok went
[11524.56] down because my phone
[11526.60] died
[11529.24] okay you have no mother so he's he's
[11532.20] refuting him completely destroying
[11534.88] him this is his n this is light and this
[11538.00] is where he's cre you know Allah's light
[11540.52] comes from this is Allah's light in
[11542.52] other words the hijab of Allah the sit
[11545.20] of Allah is the n of
[11548.92] Allah if Allah appears with his new
[11552.60] listen carefully are you with me yes yes
[11555.52] if Allah appears with his no with his
[11557.64] light no one can see uh Allah and now
[11562.48] here's here's
[11564.52] look and explains this proof
[11567.84] proves says and I quote this proves that
[11571.48] nothing can see him so if Allah appears
[11573.88] with
[11574.84] his no with with with his with his n
[11578.04] nobody can see him but if Allah appears
[11581.68] without his n without the hijab without
[11585.36] the
[11586.08] veil Muhammad was able to see him and
[11589.44] then look what it says
[11595.28] here as mentioned in the that is with
[11599.04] Muhammad seeing with his
[11600.96] eyes meaningi that is connected to the
[11604.08] mouth of your Prophet
[11618.72] look y go
[11622.60] ahead did your Prophet
[11625.52] lie no so your Prophet saw him like can
[11629.44] you zoom out can you zoom out zoom out
[11632.00] sure I full page full page so can take a

[11644.44] page yeah thank
[11647.28] you so we have not only an authentic
[11649.76] Hadith but we have an connected
[11651.56] authentic Hadith from the highest form
[11654.16] whereb abas says that I heard sing it
[11658.48] and he's not only heard it he do not
[11660.32] only heard it he's insulting the
[11662.00] questioner so if we put the English
[11664.00] translation brother so you can also take
[11665.52] a screenshot of the English translation
[11667.60] page 290 volume 7's
[11671.96] book you have no
[11675.56] mother the
[11677.60] is that is
[11680.72] from ABB and then the actual Hadith
[11687.48] okay referen is in the bottom you can
[11689.64] take a
[11696.04] screenshot the messenger of Allah in
[11698.36] this authentic Hadith said I saw Allah
[11700.76] in the image of a beadless young man
[11704.36] with curly hair wearing a green suit
[11707.24] what should we do now all right sure
[11709.72] let's say I agree what's your argument
[11711.96] you
[11712.76] agree let's I said let's say I agree
[11715.56] what's your argument the argument is why
[11717.20] do you worship a young man young a young
[11719.40] baby boy who has no
[11722.56] beard why do you Sunni Muslims worship a
[11726.32] god that is a young man with curly hair
[11728.68] he looks like Michael Jackson in the 70s
[11730.40] and
[11731.12] 80s first of all this is a dream this a
[11734.64] dream no no no no no no no no no not
[11736.52] dream it says with the eyes with the
[11739.24] eyes brother seeing with the
[11743.12] eye when you there's a dream there's no
[11745.52] seeing with the eye it's a dream so my
[11748.40] question is very simple
[11755.88] look
[11758.48] is the night Journey as we call it in
[11760.96] English was it a dream or did it
[11763.20] literally
[11764.20] happen but like I said let's answer my
[11766.76] question answer I'm refusing you I'm
[11768.16] refusing you and and I'm asking you a
[11770.52] question by feing you it's very simple
[11772.68] and again brother I'm not here to fight
[11774.36] you you're my brother in humanity and
[11776.52] only only the truth will set everybody
[11778.24] free s
[11780.92] yes you said it's a dream question since
[11785.08] this is about the night Journey when
[11786.60] Muhammad jump on bak and he goes to get
[11788.64] the 50
[11790.20] prayers did that actually happen or did
[11792.76] that happen in a
[11796.32] dream what repeat it I did not hear it's
[11799.32] not actually it's not specific stat in
[11802.16] brother brother I'm asking you did
[11804.52] Muhammad actually did it happened or was
[11808.56] it a
[11810.84] dream is the night Journey a true
[11814.08] happening did it literally happened or
[11816.48] was it in a dream was Muhammad dreaming
[11819.44] it wait I I have a source that that's
[11822.32] saying it was dreaming it all right what
[11824.40] is your Source yeah let me get my
[11829.24] right so according to you the night
[11831.36] Journey was a
[11832.72] dream I want you to say it the night
[11835.24] journey of Muhammad was a dream no first
[11838.84] of within the night Journey you think he
[11840.88] cannot Dream Within the night Journey
[11842.48] I'm not saying the whole night Journey
[11843.76] was so Muhammad was dreaming on his
[11845.24] horse on the on the winged
[11849.68] [Music]
[11852.52] horse and Muhammad is flying to the
[11854.64] seven
[11856.32] Heavens Hi jel how are you jel nice to
[11859.16] meet you jiel hi Moses how are you Moses
[11863.52] Muhammad is
[11864.68] sleeping is that what you're saying
[11869.12] [Music]
[11870.32] Muhammad is streaming autopilot
[11872.80] autopilot right Muhammad is on autopilot
[11875.44] dream where does it where does it say
[11877.48] it's in the night
[11880.32] Journey when did all when did Muhammad
[11882.56] see Allah when did Muhammad get the 50
[11885.80] prayers well it doesn't even it doesn't
[11888.24] say specifically in the Hadith you the
[11891.28] thing you sent from right now am I right
[11894.88] is this when this what what is the
[11896.48] context behind this is not when Muhammad
[11898.76] goes fly on the on the Bak to get the 50
[11902.40] prayers of Allah first he starts in
[11905.16] Mecca then he went he goes to let's say
[11907.84] Medina and from Medina to Jerusalem and
[11909.88] then from from Jerusalem to the seven
[11913.88] Heavens to get the 50 prayers yes or no
[11917.84] no I think again question is simple
[11920.88] question my question is very simple I
[11922.20] want you to answer yes
[11928.52] G or is it is it did it happen through a
[11932.76] dream or was it physical happening did
[11936.92] it truly happen real
[11939.40] happening be honest so in other words
[11943.28] what I'm saying is what I'm saying is
[11945.08] what I'm saying this this is what I'm
[11946.84] saying you
[11948.56] know is this did this truly happen or
[11951.52] was it this a
[11953.24] dream so what if I have a source of Jah
[11957.36] saying that this this Hadith cannot be
[11960.08] proven then then we
[11962.96] have is lying about an authentic Hadith
[11966.12] because theith
[11967.28] is all right so let's fact fact check
[11970.72] your source that you sent fact check my
[11972.48] source and then I will show you what
[11974.24] imami says about someone like what do
[11977.36] you

[12304.64] your honest opinion all right so let's
[12306.64] talk about uh Muhammad Lust For wife no
[12309.12] no we will we will go there we will go
[12312.20] yeah before we uh go
[12314.96] there why do you worship a young
[12318.32] boy without a beard so if we put an
[12321.96] illustration brother just to to get
[12323.68] ourselves an idea Allah according to
[12327.68] your prophet in this authentic Hadith
[12330.28] looks like
[12333.28] this you
[12336.80] agree which book is
[12339.16] it which book is it yeah you said books
[12342.60] like this and which book was it
[12346.36] here is the book yeah go down we're
[12349.76] showing him the books and then he's
[12351.64] still asking which books is it after 20
[12354.52] minutes he's still asking me
[12362.24] which first he came tough he said it's
[12364.64] not true it's not uh we don't accept it
[12367.36] then when I showed him that his mother
[12369.60] Aisha was
[12371.32] mistaken giving her own interpretation
[12373.80] even Abbas insulted the questioner
[12377.56] we're already giving you the book man
[12379.00] you still asking for a book which
[12385.40] book um I want to uh thank the Shia
[12389.28] Muslim earlier for having a very
[12391.60] respectful and very civilized discussion
[12394.04] that was awesome discussion I liked it
[12397.00] but you see the Sunni Muslims have have
[12398.92] issues they are slow
[12401.52] man so when you're a Sunni clearly guys
[12404.08] when you're a Sunni Muslim
[12408.56] um you have
[12410.84] issues and the issue is either you're
[12413.12] going to accept your Sunni
[12416.16] Islam and be blind and mute and
[12420.52] deaf or you're going to leave Sunni
[12422.96] Islam become either Shia I don't advise
[12425.24] you to become Shia though but you have
[12428.68] to become either Shia or an atheist or
[12431.72] agnostic and if you want to follow the
[12434.32] actual truth I advise you to accept
[12436.56] Jesus as your lord and savior it's much
[12438.92] better because you're still stuck in the
[12441.08] middle you're still stuck to
[12444.92] Muhammad question is simple why do you
[12447.00] worship a young boy no Sunni Muslim can
[12449.52] answer the
[12452.60] question you can do all kind of damage
[12455.60] control but you won't
[12459.56] succeed guys I'm really uh tired to be
[12462.64] honest with you I think any moments from
[12464.44] now my wife will knock on the door

[12468.88] nice some nice damage today I hope you
