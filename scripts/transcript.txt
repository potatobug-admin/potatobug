[327.84] streams they will immediately silence as
[329.92] they will not allow us to
[332.92] speak today's topic
[335.92] um could be a little bit interesting for
[338.64] a lot of people who are maybe new to
[340.48] Islam most people who know about Islam
[343.52] who have been following us for a long
[345.44] time or maybe they've studied Islam for
[348.52] what it is they know that what you see
[350.76] on the screen is a big fat lie any
[353.68] Muslim who claim that Islam is a
[355.00] religion of peace or the word Islam
[358.20] means peace he's is a Jah he's a MKE and
[361.40] he's either a liar an ignoramus or a
[364.52] deceiver it's one of the three right you
[367.84] can't be serious about
[370.64] Islam and peace in one sentence it's an
[373.60] oxymoron it's a contradiction it's a
[376.60] contradiction to put the word peace and
[380.40] Islam in one sentence doesn't make

[702.36] nothing but lies maybe when they listen

[776.76] speaking from cave
[782.28] we are back baby we are live baby let's
[785.16] go all right all right all right let us
[788.28] start man let us start all
[791.40] right as you see guys what I'm putting
[793.92] on the screen if Muslims
[797.04] truly who claim to have dignity and
[800.76] honor when they think about is Islam
[806.80] actually compatible with
[809.84] our way of life today in 2024 should
[812.96] Islam lead
[814.68] you as a Muslim or should you actually
[817.28] think about considering about leaving
[819.68] Islam and why are there so many Muslims
[822.44] leaving Islam lately we would have never
[826.00] dreamt of the idea to see so many
[829.12] apostates I never heard of apostasy
[832.04] before guys when I was still living in
[835.04] the Middle East because as you may know
[838.12] or maybe you don't know
[839.84] I'm originally from the Middle
[842.80] East but I've never seen ex-muslims
[845.32] before but in the
[847.60] last 10 years maybe more than 10 years
[851.60] especially the last couple of 3 four
[854.56] years let's say it's like an avalanche
[858.36] man it's it's a tsunami I think Imam bil
[860.84] Phillips was right about it why are so
[863.48] many Muslims leaving Islam because they
[865.68] are
[867.20] slowly starting to think for themselves
[869.60] because of the internet the internet is
[872.36] literally choking
[874.64] Islam is choking Islam it's slowly you
[880.00] know getting the
[882.36] oxygen out of Islam it's choking it has
[886.16] it in it a choke hold literally guys you
[888.40] know MMA Style baby yeah in a choke hold
[892.72] and that's why so many Muslims are
[894.32] leaving Islam and here have our famous
[896.92] brother in humanity Dr yes
[900.04] who said There are holes in this stand
[901.92] narrative just because of that inter
[903.96] interview hundreds and hundreds of
[905.96] Muslims started to adopt
[909.80] Islam and became Muslims uh ex-muslims
[913.32] apostates
[915.88] right anyone who has honor and dignity
[918.80] should stay away far from Islam you
[921.12] can't claim to be a human being with
[924.24] some morals honor and dignity and
[926.72] self-respect and be a Muslim at this
[929.12] same time you can be
[931.00] honest and a Muslim at the same time
[933.76] that would be a
[935.16] contradiction an honest Muslim have to
[938.04] become automatically an ex-muslim that's
[940.72] my only conclusion after talking to so
[943.68] many Muslims in the last let's say 15 to
[946.60] 20 years I have no idea how long I'm
[948.36] doing this guys I lost track to be
[951.00] honest with you I keep saying 15 years
[952.72] for the last five
[954.36] years so
[956.44] yeah to show you guys why actually early
[960.12] Muslims even the early Muslims became
[962.04] Muslims why the early
[964.92] Muslims in the 7th
[968.16] Century right why they became Muslims
[970.88] just to give you an
[975.44] idea right just to give you an idea why
[979.32] people joined Islam because remember
[982.40] they didn't join Islam because Islam is
[984.80] such a wonderful or True Religion
[990.68] right they didn't join Islam because
[992.64] it's such a wonderful or True Religion
[995.00] they joined Islam for other reasons
[997.24] right they remember Islam was not spread
[999.84] in the
[1000.76] beginning because of you know
[1004.16] conversions
[1005.96] no it be it's was spread through the
[1009.12] sword they put the sword on people's
[1011.00] necks and here's the proof on the screen
[1013.48] in the book of the
[1017.04] biography byb is
[1020.56] next there is nothing called
[1024.00] is it's edited
[1026.80] literally IB Hisham who come came much
[1029.36] later he destroyed the IB ish the
[1033.08] original IB ishak there is nothing
[1034.52] called Original IB is it does not exist
[1036.52] anymore it's a let's say an edited
[1039.64] version by ibam they still attributed to
[1043.24] is but that's
[1044.40] not you know there's no honesty in you
[1047.52] know in that so the life of Muhammad by
[1051.20] IB
[1052.88] okay that's what we call this is the
[1055.16] English translation by aami okay on page

[1149.40] on the screen here is a very interesting
[1154.08] story The Affair of moesia and
[1157.96] haia funny
[1159.88] names but these are people who became
[1162.48] Muslims and look actually one of them at
[1165.64] least became a Muslim look Muhammad
[1170.72] said Muhammad said guys keep tap the
[1174.16] screen on Tik Tok keep destroying or
[1177.52] smashing that like button tap tap tap
[1181.28] tap subscribe if you didn't already drop
[1184.32] a follow on Tik Tok if you didn't
[1186.48] already uh you know the algorithms
[1189.40] Muhammad
[1190.56] said Muhammad said un alive any Jew wait
[1195.56] I thought Islam is a religion of peace
[1200.52] and Alive any Jew that falls into your
[1202.40] power so if you grab any
[1209.00] Jew
[1210.92] what emotional damage I thought that
[1214.52] Allah is the most loving God and
[1216.68] Muhammad is a Mercy to
[1219.36] Mankind I don't see any mercy
[1222.60] here you see Bloodshed see
[1227.64] murder that's what I
[1229.80] see so that's what Muhammad said that's
[1232.24] what he ordered the Muslims to do the
[1234.76] sahab to
[1236.48] do thereon
[1238.76] M Mas leapt upon IB that gu always these
[1244.00] names right a Jewish Merchant with whom
[1247.20] they had social and business relations
[1250.20] and unived them
[1253.00] why why you unal living the guy because
[1255.96] Muhammad said so but what did this
[1258.96] Jewish merchant do he didn't do anything
[1261.52] wrong he needs to be alive because he's
[1263.96] a Jew the guy is a hardworking Merchant
[1266.56] he's providing food on the table for his
[1268.60] children for his family why did you un
[1271.44] alive him because he happens to be a
[1273.60] Jew
[1276.92] you didn't you order me to do that ah
[1279.72] okay yeah I forgot you know Muhammad
[1282.16] used to forget Quran more than his
[1284.04] changing his dirty socks but any anyway
[1286.52] so a Jewish Merchant was un alived just
[1289.88] because he happened to be a Jew haa was
[1292.84] not a Muslim at the time though he was
[1295.16] the elder brother when Mesa analyed him
[1299.36] haa began to beat him saying you enemy
[1301.88] of Allah you enemy of Allah did you just
[1304.92] analiz him when much of the fat on your
[1307.48] belly comes from his wealth so you
[1311.20] analized him you murderer you analyed
[1315.16] him while you literally earned money
[1317.92] from him your the the fat on your belly
[1320.72] comes from his wealth why did you do
[1323.44] that Mesa answered had the one who
[1326.64] ordered me to un alive
[1330.40] him to un alive
[1333.32] you had the one meaning Muhammad had the
[1336.64] one meaning Muhammad had Muhammad who
[1338.32] ordered me to un alive the Jewish
[1340.96] Merchant ordered me to un alive you too
[1344.76] I would have cut your head off your head
[1348.96] would have come off
[1350.72] clean why because Islam is a peaceful
[1353.72] religion that's why Muslims became
[1355.64] Muslims in the first
[1357.16] place it has nothing to do with the
[1359.96] truth it has to do with Bloodshed you
[1362.72] know you have always evil people on on
[1366.04] on this planet and they join certain
[1368.88] demonic Cults like Islam for other
[1371.68] reasons they love power they love
[1374.64] Bloodshed they hunger for blood they
[1377.88] thirst for blood and flesh right and
[1382.12] carnal desires Muhammad said if you come
[1384.20] and fight for me don't worry be Happ if
[1386.68] you get unived Allah already purchased
[1388.56] your soul for you uh this is the Quran
[1392.60] chapter 9 Ayah 111 remember the order
[1396.08] replied by Allah if Muhammad had ordered
[1398.36] you to analy me would you have analyed
[1400.96] me question
[1402.12] mark by Allah if Muhammad had ordered
[1405.20] you to analiz me would you have un
[1408.64] alived me he said yes by Allah I would
[1412.28] have unived you to taken off your head
[1414.72] from your
[1415.68] body had he ordered me to cut off your
[1418.64] head I would have done so why I didn't
[1421.40] do anything
[1422.44] wrong but you're going against Muhammad
[1425.28] the moment you disobey Muhammad whoever
[1427.36] you are your head will come off
[1429.64] clean I mean guys this is this must be a
[1432.16] true Prophet Kal I'm going to take my
[1434.40] shahada like the early Muslims in the
[1436.80] sth century I'm convinced that Muhammad
[1439.20] is a
[1442.04] prophet right Muslims aren't you
[1444.20] convinced like me now that Muhammad is a
[1446.00] true Prophet guys keep tapping the
[1448.36] screen and invite come on guys
[1451.44] invite invite people come
[1456.12] on drop the link to the today's live
[1459.08] stream on social media guys invite
[1461.00] invite invite he exclaimed by Allah a
[1464.08] religion and look guys why he became a
[1466.40] Muslim he exclaimed by Allah
[1469.08] a religion which can bring you to this
[1471.72] is marvelous and he became a Muslim so
[1475.32] why did he become a Muslim because he
[1477.00] saw how bloodthirsty these people are
[1479.36] how passionate these people are to to to
[1483.04] draw blood to unal life people just
[1486.84] because Muhammad ordered them to do that
[1489.64] why because someone happens to be a Jew
[1491.92] someone maybe happens to be a
[1494.00] Christian someone who who doesn't want
[1496.56] to become a Muslim that's why why they
[1498.60] become Muslims because Islam was created
[1500.84] for such people Islam was not created
[1503.44] for the truth Islam was created for
[1505.96] power for power hungry people people who
[1509.04] wanted to enslave mankind people who
[1512.60] wanted to Grape
[1514.44] women and take their children as their
[1519.80] slaves slave trads that's what Islam was
[1523.20] good for Islam has nothing to do with
[1525.20] the truth guys Islam is a political
[1527.72] ideology
[1528.84] to enslave the entire
[1532.16] planet do you see it that's the reason
[1534.56] why people became
[1536.28] Muslims that's the only reason and it's
[1539.24] in front of
[1540.88] you again guys this is the biography
[1544.64] about the life of Muhammad Phil can you
[1547.60] drop the link again
[1549.04] brother page 369 and if you scroll down
[1553.00] you'll see what I just read for you in
[1554.96] let's see the middle of the page all
[1557.08] right
[1559.20] to give you an idea here's a beautiful
[1560.96] illustration that I picked up from the
[1563.12] internet right when Muslims used to
[1566.28] literally when Muhammad and
[1568.32] his sik as we call them in the Arabic
[1571.80] right these Outlaws you know when you
[1574.44] watch Cowboy old cowboy movies you know
[1577.00] these Outlaws these gang members that's
[1580.44] what Muslims were they were robbers they
[1583.48] used to even Rob the Caravans of the
[1587.32] family of Muhammad
[1589.12] the tribe and family of Muhammad honest
[1592.00] people who are living an honest life
[1595.56] trading you know risking their lives
[1597.68] going to other countries and and bring
[1599.48] Goods with them what did Muhammad do
[1602.24] attack these Caravans these camels with
[1604.92] the Caravans and steal their money and
[1607.00] goods why because Muhammad was a robber
[1609.56] he was a thief yet they claim he is the
[1613.40] best example the final Prophet the Seal
[1616.20] of all the prophets
[1618.88] what is this nonsense
[1622.44] Muslims and yes Isis guys all of
[1627.12] these groups are actually the real
[1629.88] Muslims not these Muslims these
[1631.68] cowardice Muslims who live
[1633.92] a comfortable life let's say here in the
[1636.84] west maybe they have a 9 to5 job you
[1640.84] know like I said you can be a
[1644.00] Muslim you can't be an honest Muslim you
[1647.32] can't be a Human Being With Honor and
[1650.52] dignity and self-respect or you know
[1653.40] respect for human beings and be a Muslim
[1656.72] at the same time an honest Muslim has to
[1660.56] become automatically an ex-muslim
[1665.36] right I mean guys you get the idea right
[1668.12] you get the
[1670.56] idea and honest Muslims are even getting
[1674.64] bored of Islam you know I've been
[1676.28] showing this picture I can't show it
[1677.64] enough guys to be honest with you I need
[1679.32] to show it almost on every live stream
[1682.48] even arabic speaking Muslims from the
[1684.68] heart of Islam in Saudi Arabia Google it
[1687.08] if you don't believe me they even
[1688.96] started to throw their old
[1690.96] qurans in the sewers blocking the sewers
[1694.76] in the
[1695.96] process right because they are so bored
[1699.96] of Islam throwing their qurans and
[1702.64] blocking the sewage
[1706.04] systems exactly Dena say the religion of
[1709.40] the sword brother fitas exactly denus
[1712.04] save means the religion of the sword
[1713.84] that's what Islam is okay that's what
[1716.64] Islam
[1720.72] is is there any Muslim who wants to come
[1723.36] up as a guest you can come up as a guest
[1726.48] either on Discord or or on Tik
[1731.92] Tok you can join our Discord and come up
[1734.72] as a guest or you can come up as a guest
[1737.68] on Tik Tok guys so there are
[1740.12] multiple ways to come up and have a
[1742.72] conversation with me if you think that

[1770.28] most Muslims will tell you you know Rob
[1772.40] why are you talking about Islam Rob Rob
[1774.84] for you your religion for me My Religion
[1779.04] Rob and specifically ay number six that
[1782.12] they parot like crazy ignorant Muslims
[1785.04] either guys when they recite this verse
[1787.36] for you your religion and for me is my
[1791.20] religion when they say that guys right
[1794.00] when they quote chapter 109 ay 6 right
[1800.00] for you your religion for me is My
[1801.68] Religion for you your food for me my
[1805.00] food for me my humus and for for you
[1808.32] your humus when they quote that either
[1811.20] they are deceiving you try to deceive
[1813.92] you or if you're ignorant about their
[1815.52] religion maybe you're new to Islam you
[1817.20] have no idea what Islam truly means
[1819.44] specifically here these ignorant people
[1821.24] here in the west right who are not
[1824.28] warning their children against this evil
[1826.64] infiltrating demon killed who is trying
[1829.72] to slowly infiltrate the West because
[1832.48] there are so many idiots out there and I
[1835.16] I have to say it as it is guys so many
[1838.68] idiot Western People liberals who don't
[1842.32] know anything about Islam and you know
[1844.48] they're destroying their beautiful
[1847.12] Western countries by allowing these
[1848.84] people to invade their countries with
[1851.36] this demonic Cil of
[1854.20] Muhammad they will quote this not
[1856.20] telling you that this a is
[1858.52] abated chapter 109 a 6 is
[1864.32] abated or maybe you know maybe some
[1866.80] people love to use the word
[1869.24] Abed abated Yes you heard it
[1872.48] correctly yes it's still in the Quran as
[1874.76] you see in chapter 109 ayat 6 but
[1878.12] Muslims cannot use it
[1880.08] anymore why Rob can they can't use it
[1882.60] because it's abated why is it abated
[1885.44] because Allah abrogated it which chapter
[1888.32] 9 Ayah 5 on the screen and when the
[1891.56] sacred months have passed then unive the
[1894.52] polytheist wherever you find them and
[1896.20] captur them and besieged them etc etc
[1899.24] etc right so chapter 109 I6 got abated
[1904.40] by chapter 9y 5 or ayat safe a safe as
[1909.36] we call it a safe which is chapter 9 I
[1913.28] of five on itself abated more than
[1918.92] 124 peaceful meccan AAS meccan period
[1922.32] AAS when Muhammad was in Mecca and he
[1924.40] had no Army he had no power he he had to
[1927.32] be peaceful towards everyone and
[1930.16] everybody trying to convince people and
[1932.44] they didn't even buy it only handful of
[1934.28] Muslims become Muslims right a handful
[1936.24] of people became Muslims around 70
[1938.68] between 70 to 100 people maximum became
[1941.32] Muslims imagine Muhammad stayed there
[1943.64] for at least 10 years he stayed in Mecca
[1947.24] for at least 10 years
[1948.40] years and not many people joined his
[1952.24] religion his new found religion his new
[1955.12] man-made religion why because they knew
[1957.44] he's a liar he's he's he's a fake
[1960.68] prophet and remember in the time of
[1963.00] Muhammad there were many false prophets
[1964.88] he was not the only one remember the
[1967.60] name who they call mus he was a prophet
[1970.72] the wife of mus was also a prophetes
[1973.96] there were many false prophets during
[1975.40] the time of Muhammad right
[1979.16] much later Abu Bakr when he commanded KH
[1983.16] he went and he analyzed mus
[1987.52] right exactly the religion of rest in
[1990.84] peace or pieces exactly you got the idea
[1994.16] guys that's what truly Islam means so
[1997.60] guys much later Medina a and many
[2001.92] scholars even claim that chapter 9 is
[2004.24] could be the last Surah some some of
[2006.76] them say chapter five the table al- MAA
[2010.08] is the last Surah but clearly it's in
[2012.40] the
[2013.48] last period in in the life of Muhammad
[2016.56] when Muhammad is in full power he's
[2018.76] basically the king of Arabia of the hij
[2021.96] nobody can speak against him without uh
[2025.12] you know not losing his
[2027.92] head right the moment you criticize
[2030.60] Muhammad your head will come off clean
[2032.96] as you noticed in uh the
[2036.52] last part that we read earlier right
[2043.40] in right so just to give you an idea how
[2047.48] Muslims who don't know that religion or
[2049.56] they're trying to deceive you they will
[2051.48] use abated verses like these here in
[2053.84] chapter 109 ay 6 and it's not me saying
[2056.64] it look Scholars like
[2059.92] Ali ad theit that the Ayah is abated
[2063.88] chapter 109 Ayah
[2066.00] 6 for you your religion
[2068.24] for me your religion for your religion
[2070.92] for me my
[2072.64] religion has been abated and abated by
[2076.00] what by ayat safe ayat to safe is
[2079.40] chapter 9 Ayah 5 abated chapter 109 Ayah
[2085.24] 6 did you catch
[2086.88] it chapter 905 Ayah 905 abated Ayah 109
[2092.68] ay 6 chapter 109 ay
[2096.24] 6 so Rob if you copy this what does it
[2099.00] say let's copy it and we go to Google
[2101.24] Translate to give you an idea what the
[2102.80] scholars say right in the for the
[2106.04] AY the verse was abreg by the verse of
[2109.52] the sword the verse of the sword is
[2112.12] chapter 9 IAH 5 so like I said earlier
[2114.80] on itself chapter 9 Ayah 5 on itself
[2118.36] abated more than
[2120.72] 124 peaceful mechan
[2123.60] period you see how knowledge exactly
[2126.08] Mary how knowledge destroys Islam how
[2129.04] knowledge teach Real Islam because
[2131.88] Muslims will miscode their Quran on
[2137.04] purpose any Muslim who thinks that I'm
[2145.56] lying let's see if this is a
[2154.20] Muslim yes
[2157.96] unmute my friend
[2165.04] unmute yeah when you learn how to use
[2167.92] your mic come back
[2171.84] again yeah people don't even know how to
[2174.08] use their
[2175.80] mics kept muted all the time anyway so
[2179.56] you get the idea guys the Ayah is abated
[2183.16] completely abated all right by want
[2187.72] chapter 9 Ayah
[2189.64] 5 all right and for example in Surah
[2193.68] Muhammad Ayah 35 so be not weak and ask
[2198.00] not for peace from the enemies of Islam
[2201.12] while you are having the upper hand
[2203.76] Allah is with you and will never
[2206.04] decrease the reward of your good deeds
[2207.96] so guys what's going on here
[2209.92] is Allah is commanding their hypocrite
[2213.84] Muslims right you Muslims if you're
[2216.76] strong enough if you have enough
[2219.48] power do not make
[2222.04] peace with the non-believers right do
[2225.88] not make peace with the disbelievers in
[2231.12] other words guys what is going on in
[2234.16] what is going on what is going on is
[2236.96] this one
[2239.16] Muslims will use
[2242.20] abated
[2244.40] verses when they are weak
[2248.00] they will use chapter 2 ay
[2249.96] 256 there is no compulsion in religion
[2253.08] they will deceive you because they're
[2254.60] weak okay they will use abrogated verses
[2258.28] and try to deceive you but when they are
[2260.72] strong
[2262.24] enough when they are strong enough and
[2264.52] they have the upper
[2266.96] hand when they have the upper
[2270.40] hand then there is no peace that's
[2276.04] basically Islam one 101 in a nutshell
[2279.52] that's Islam 101 in a nutshell when
[2283.04] Muslims are weak as we speak now Muslims
[2285.48] are weak in 2024 Muslims are weak uh the
[2289.76] United States the West
[2292.64] owns their butts but butt butt but butts
[2296.60] right the West owns the Muslim countries
[2301.24] literally the Muslim countries are our
[2303.64] lab dogs the Muslim leaders are our lab
[2306.84] dogs right that's why they try to make
[2310.08] peace with
[2311.32] us and that's why they even trade with
[2314.36] us and work with us but the moment they
[2316.56] are strong
[2317.72] enough let's say they become a nuclear
[2321.24] power strong
[2323.96] enough they think that they're strong
[2326.00] enough then there is no need for
[2328.76] peace that's how Islam Works guys so do
[2332.24] not come here and tell me how to talk
[2333.84] with Muslims because Muslims are very
[2336.48] very very
[2338.56] dangerous why are they dangerous because
[2340.84] they are allowed to lie and they are
[2343.76] allowed to use abated verses and they
[2346.60] are allowed to deceive you when they
[2348.48] talk to you as a western person or
[2350.60] anybody who is ignorant about Islam
[2353.40] Muslims are liars they must lie and they
[2356.08] are allowed to lie because Muhammad
[2358.12] allowed you to lie as a Muslim in three
[2360.64] circumstances and what in what
[2362.52] circumstance you can lie to your wife
[2364.40] you can lie when your life is in danger
[2366.88] a man can lie to lie to her to his wife
[2369.76] a wife can lie to her to her husband and
[2372.80] don't forget also when they are weak as
[2375.48] you
[2376.32] see and for them they're always at the
[2379.20] state of War so they will lie to you
[2383.00] even in debates did you catch it cuz
[2386.08] Muhammad said so he allowed them to use
[2389.52] and you know all the other different
[2391.32] flavors of lies and deception because
[2393.40] there are many nicknames for these lies
[2395.16] and
[2396.00] deceptions the catch it even dawa means
[2399.28] uh a lie when they do dawa guys it's one
[2401.96] of the flavors did you know
[2404.80] that da and goes hand in hand dawa is
[2408.68] lies da when they invite people to Islam
[2411.96] it's nothing but lie it's a big fat lie
[2414.68] they are lying to you they are allowed
[2415.84] to even lie during dawa doing dawa
[2418.36] inviting you to Islam okay dawa means
[2422.12] you are allowed to lie this is why why
[2424.16] when they debate Christians when they
[2426.84] debate non-muslims when they try to
[2430.08] invite you to Islam they are allowed to
[2432.96] lie
[2439.24] okay so when they say Islam is the
[2441.68] religion of truth that's a contradiction
[2444.16] that's a big fat lie Islam is the
[2446.32] religion of
[2448.36] lies because without lies
[2453.20] Islam emotional damage Islam Li
[2462.68] let's see maybe we have a
[2466.24] guest hey hello there hello are you a

[2729.48] you take these countries as
[2732.20] aah are you going against
[2737.36] Allah sorry I I I I just had somebody

[2752.80] 51 you said to me that the mus Muslim
[2757.40] leaders of the Muslim countries are not
[2759.48] the lab dogs of the West mm but are you
[2764.76] allowed to take as a
[2769.20] Muslim Western countries Jews and
[2771.76] Christians for example as
[2773.48] oah and still claim to be a Muslim no
[2776.92] you cannot okay so you just demonstrated
[2779.48] that I was right and you a
[2781.16] liar no no no no no you're you're mixing
[2783.80] things you ask me if I love another
[2785.84] human being mixing things no no no no no
[2787.84] yes hold on hold on let let's stick to
[2789.52] this conversation one point at the time
[2791.80] you say to me do you like Jews and
[2794.36] Christians as humans as other humans and
[2796.56] they said yes I have no issue if I am a
[2798.84] doctor I can treat Christian I can treat
[2800.48] a Jewish no problem at all I don't have
[2802.28] problem with that I'm not going to say
[2803.88] oh let him die or let him suffer because
[2805.44] he's Jews or he's Christian however
[2807.60] there's a big difference between you
[2809.60] know making a
[2812.16] Jew govern a Muslim country or making a
[2815.24] Christian govern a Muslim country where
[2816.92] everybody has to obey and declare
[2819.32] loyalty to that Jewish person Muslims
[2821.52] don't do that they don't declare the
[2824.00] loyalty to other rulers than Muslim
[2827.24] rulers loyalty we're talking about
[2829.36] loyalty about fighting for them about
[2831.12] paying taxes to them about whatever you
[2833.44] want to call it so so you know what you
[2835.04] just did you just you just did kufur you
[2838.72] just called all the Muslims who live in
[2840.56] the West for example they are all that's
[2842.88] their choice listen no just a second you
[2845.84] listen you listen yes are the Muslims
[2848.60] who live in the west who pay taxes who
[2850.68] are taking the uh uh Christian countries
[2854.32] Western countries let's say correct is
[2856.28] there aah and they even pay them taxes
[2858.20] are they only Muslim by name are they
[2859.88] Hypocrites and kufar go ahead that's
[2862.32] that's for them to determine no no I'm

[3028.28] same time it's not it's not that easy
[3030.52] right focus focus I asked you about the
[3034.24] Ayah your prophet in his Quran Allah in
[3037.40] his Quran said obey Allah and Obey
[3041.20] Muhammad if you disobey the rasool the
[3044.08] messenger Muhammad and you disobey Allah
[3047.28] you said you are not a cafir why are you
[3051.16] lying about the Quran and about your
[3053.36] Prophet is it is it so easy to just lie
[3056.36] bro
[3057.20] go ahead
[3063.72] unmute why are you lying bro you're
[3065.96] talking to Rob Christian I'm not your
[3068.60] you know regular western guy or regular
[3072.04] Christian guy who you know who who is
[3075.56] not immune for your lives brother you
[3078.48] just went against Allah and you went
[3080.44] against the prophet clearly you forgot
[3082.84] the story about two Muslim men who came
[3085.68] to Muhammad
[3087.56] right there were there were two Muslims
[3089.64] guys and this is the T for one of the AY
[3093.20] right two Muslim men came to
[3096.08] Muhammad and they had a dispute they you
[3098.44] know they they they had a problem
[3100.28] between one another Muhammad said this
[3103.68] and one of them went to Omar one of the
[3107.20] Muslims went to
[3108.60] Omar and Omar when he heard that this
[3111.64] guy you know is disobeying Muhammad he
[3114.36] didn't listen to the command of Muhammad
[3117.04] Omar took out his sword and chopped off
[3120.96] his
[3121.92] head
[3124.00] so I challenge you to say
[3127.24] Omar who later became the second kff of
[3130.04] the umah was wrong when he chopped or he
[3133.84] took off the head of that Muslim who
[3137.04] disobeyed
[3138.84] Muhammad Omar was
[3143.40] wrong so guys disobeying Muhammad on on
[3146.96] on himself forget about Allah because
[3148.48] Allah is a nobody in Islam if you
[3150.92] disobey the prophet your head will come
[3154.36] off
[3155.56] clean so you're a you're
[3158.88] a you see this is why I always say most
[3161.88] Muslims are only Muslim by
[3164.64] name most Muslims are only Muslim by
[3169.68] name now he's still muted I think he's
[3171.84] still talking to himself let's see if we
[3174.32] can uh bring another
[3179.48] question let's see if we have another
[3188.20] guest yes user
[3191.12] hello can you hear me
[3194.72] mhm go ahead wait give me a
[3202.40] second yes go ahead
[3213.16] yeah okay uh Muslims if you don't know
[3216.08] how the mic works please do not come up
[3218.44] don't waste your time and do not waste
[3220.12] our
[3221.20] time you see guys what kind of liars
[3224.08] Muslims
[3224.96] are the mental gymnastics is just crazy
[3229.64] man the moment you disobey Muhammad your
[3232.52] head will come off clean Muslims be
[3235.68] careful man be careful because your
[3238.24] blood will come Halal okay so guys what
[3242.40] I told you earlier
[3244.88] okay for example in Chapter 2 I 191 191
[3249.72] says un alive the unbeliever slay the
[3252.04] unbelievers wherever you find them and
[3254.20] this is when they are strong enough do
[3255.84] you see
[3257.00] it the
[3258.84] difference when you're strong enough
[3261.28] there's no need to lie there's no need
[3263.96] to deceive non-muslims in the West for
[3267.08] example or anybody is ignorant about
[3269.48] Islam and you are strong enough then
[3272.56] there is no need for peace they will
[3274.20] come for you they will come for your
[3275.64] women they will come for your daughters
[3277.92] brothers and sisters in Christianity and
[3280.04] everybody who's not a Muslim who's
[3281.60] listening they will come for you they
[3284.36] will take your wealth they will take
[3286.36] your car they will take your house they
[3288.32] will take your mother sister and
[3291.52] daughter okay but when they are weak and
[3295.44] the West owns their
[3298.44] ass they will use abrogated verses like
[3301.40] chapter 109 ayat 6 you have your
[3304.00] religion I'll have mine do you see it
[3307.12] this is
[3308.56] Islam 101 this is Islam 101 they will
[3313.24] use abreg verses when they are weak
[3315.36] because they're allowed to deceive you
[3317.08] but when they are strong enough they
[3318.40] will come after you when they have the
[3321.40] upper hand and they are a power to be
[3324.80] dealt with then there's There's No Cry
[3326.96] For Peace anymore there is no need for
[3329.52] you know I have I have Christian friends
[3332.04] I have Muslim friends Rob Christian
[3333.76] brother I can disobey Allah and I can
[3336.40] disobey theol and I still claim to be a
[3338.40] muslim okay all of these lies and
[3341.36] deception is out of the window in the SE
[3343.36] where it belongs you see guys this on
[3346.48] the screen I I put this picture on the
[3348.80] screen for you to give you an idea take
[3350.64] a screenshot and always remind yourself
[3354.00] the difference between a Muslim who is
[3355.52] in power
[3356.88] and a Muslim who's weak where the West
[3360.24] ows their ass when they are too weak to
[3363.40] come for you when they have to make
[3366.64] friends they they have to become friends
[3369.36] they even are allowed to to you know
[3371.80] they are allow because war is deception
[3373.80] and they're always at war with you so
[3375.96] they are allowed to deceive you because
[3377.88] that's what Muhammad said in the Sunnah
[3380.04] Muhammad said you can lie to your
[3383.04] enemies when you're weak you can lie to
[3385.80] non-muslims
[3387.20] the picture is the picture
[3390.52] is do you see it very
[3394.72] very let's see let's
[3397.88] see Christians do not come up

[3944.16] is the Old Link because you know they
[3946.04] took it
[3949.08] down

[3955.92] is slow though the website is very
[3959.96] slow the website is
[3962.32] slow okay so that you know think they
[3965.84] are

[4109.12] you know I need to be even more clear
[4110.68] than that Christians uh thank you okay
[4114.32] for wasting your time and my
[4117.20] time let's
[4124.16] see yes
[4126.08] hello yes Mr Robert hello are you musl
[4130.20] yes I am and if you want somebody to
[4131.88] talk to you you have to give them the
[4133.04] chance to talk too okay go ahead
[4136.08] okay all right so when you say that the
[4139.40] Muslims the the ver was obligated by the
[4143.24] one before uh it's because you're trying
[4146.32] to say that Islam is the religion of the
[4148.88] sword has Islam oh look Islam has spread
[4152.72] to so many different countries and so
[4154.20] many areas of the world have they ever
[4156.56] exterminated the population have they
[4159.16] ever inhal a full population from
[4162.32] existence look Pakistan is a Muslim
[4164.60] country but it's ruled by Pakistani
[4166.92] people and it's inhabited by Pakistani
[4169.08] people India has Muslim people Indonesia
[4171.76] is the largest Muslim country but who is
[4174.76] in in Indonesia Indonesian people North
[4178.52] Africa Middle East everywhere people
[4182.60] convert to Islam but they keep their
[4184.84] land they keep their country and they
[4187.32] stay in their country there is no
[4189.80] there's no country called Islam that
[4192.36] invades countries and kills everybody
[4195.92] that exist can you use the word can you
[4198.96] not use the k word all right okay so
[4202.72] Islam is a religion what that people
[4205.68] accept and once that's done the country
[4209.68] belongs to them and they still own the
[4211.36] country that's all I wanted to say so
[4212.96] how did they how did how did Islam
[4214.72] conquer all these countries but with the
[4216.44] truth or did they conquer these
[4218.40] countries with the
[4220.16] sword well Islam you know how was Islam
[4223.32] spread how let me rephrase my question
[4225.32] question how was Islam
[4227.44] spread first Islam is spread peacefully
[4230.96] there was never a war in Indonesia there
[4232.92] was never a war in Pakistan you
[4235.60] disgusting
[4236.64] liar on you and your lies Islam was
[4239.84] spread peacefully do you hear it guys
[4242.28] this is why I don't have respect for
[4243.96] liars and deceivers guys Islam was
[4246.28] spread peacefully you hear
[4248.68] it
[4253.44] like you disgusting human being it's an
[4257.56] insult to the rest of the human beings
[4259.80] to call you humans okay disgusting liars
[4264.80] and the Ser he forgot how Islam was
[4267.84] spread guys you see I I'm asking him
[4270.08] honest question you have no honor you
[4272.44] have no
[4273.48] dignity you have no honor you have no
[4276.08] dignity to be a Muslim you have to throw
[4278.68] your honor dignity away because you
[4281.00] cannot be a Muslim and be honest at the
[4284.68] same time
[4291.28] can't okay you can't you can't be an
[4295.04] honest Muslim does not
[4297.72] exist an honest Muslim does not
[4301.00] exist
[4303.48] okay an honest Muslim does not
[4306.60] exist Muhammad stayed for 10 years in
[4309.68] Mecca nobody accepted him only a handful
[4312.04] of people when he went to Medina and he
[4315.80] started to grow in power and he guarded
[4319.52] himself an
[4321.00] army with the money that
[4323.48] he got from Khadijah for example and
[4326.24] also from the money and the wealth that
[4328.80] he got from robbing the Caravans of his
[4331.32] own family his own tribe the meccans and
[4333.64] the qur of Mecca then things started to
[4336.96] change and shift 180
[4339.08] degrees Muhammad in Mecca was peaceful
[4341.76] Muhammad 2.0 in Medina became
[4346.28] uh a
[4349.28] bloodthirsty
[4353.40] murderer okay why are you lying I'm
[4356.76] giving you a platform do not lie to my
[4358.84] face I will bury
[4361.36] you I'll bury
[4368.92] you yes hello

[4382.92] a wrong uh bad
[4389.56] connection yeah he's not coming

[4426.00] why I'm using a very good mixer with a
[4429.08] very good
[4432.64] mic that's why
[4437.04] and for the people who are on Tik Tok
[4438.56] this is my
[4443.20] microphone that's why it's so
[4449.72] good all
[4452.04] right guys to give you an idea what
[4454.12] Islam truly means and is maybe you have
[4457.64] heard or maybe you have never heard of
[4459.48] the three stages of jihad before there's
[4463.12] something called the three stages of
[4465.40] Jihad that Muslims literally practice
[4468.08] here in the west stage one maybe you
[4471.32] want to take a screenshot brothers and
[4472.84] sisters I advise you to take a
[4474.52] screenshot and let this printed be let
[4477.80] let this one be printed on the back of
[4480.56] your heads in your mind stage one is
[4484.56] Muslims are the minority and they must
[4487.28] obey the laws of the Western Country
[4489.16] they live in they are nothing but
[4491.12] Hypocrites okay they disobey the Quran
[4494.80] they they disobey Allah and his
[4496.92] rasool and mode is
[4499.52] on they are hypocrites they are only
[4502.08] Muslim by names because even Muhammad
[4504.52] said in a very authentic Hadith in Sun
[4506.40] AB da if you live among the kufar you're
[4509.24] one of them so Muhammad basically washed
[4512.00] his hands from these wannab be hypocrite
[4515.64] Muslims stage number two Muslims in the
[4519.20] west let's say there are the majority in
[4521.52] some neighborhoods City or even
[4523.80] Community but
[4525.84] must still obey the laws of the Western
[4528.68] Country they live in the mode is still
[4532.16] on they are allowed to lie they will
[4534.56] deceive you you know for you your
[4536.48] religion for Me Mine there is no
[4538.60] compulsion religion you know the
[4540.16] abrogated verses and when you have stage
[4543.68] three when Muslims already conquered
[4547.20] that land and they already implemented
[4549.96] Sharia law in that conquered land and
[4552.52] started to force Jizzy on the Jews and
[4554.44] the Christians
[4556.20] which is nothing but Mafia protection
[4557.88] money or else pay like the mafia does
[4562.44] pay or else will will burn you will cut
[4565.64] off your head it will take your wives
[4567.20] your daughters precious daughters as our
[4570.04] dingy dingy slaves and then there is no
[4572.52] need for there is no need for
[4575.64] peace that's what I said earlier chapter
[4578.20] 47 for example a 35 will be applied so
[4582.48] be not weak and ask not for peace when
[4585.36] you have the upper hand do you see stage
[4588.16] three here stage three is the final
[4593.16] stage right where Muslims are in full
[4596.12] power there is no need for lies anymore
[4598.60] we are strong enough we
[4601.84] can enslave you and Conquer your country
[4605.00] there is no need for lies
[4607.36] anymore yeah I mean why would you need
[4609.52] to lie if if you're strong enough right
[4612.12] you have enough power there is no need
[4613.64] to lie anymore and they will apply the
[4617.20] non abated verses like 47 Ayah
[4621.28] 35 and this one goes out of the window
[4624.88] for you your religion and for me mine
[4628.48] and they will apply chapter 9 Ayah 5 as
[4630.76] you see guys and they will apply chapter
[4633.48] 2 I
[4635.68] 191 did you catch it so when they are
[4639.48] strong
[4641.00] enough straight to stage three but when
[4643.88] they are weak like today Muslim
[4646.52] countries are
[4647.92] weak we own
[4650.60] them did you catch it safe uh there is
[4653.76] no need for you to every week when I go
[4656.56] live you mention some guy some nobody's
[4659.40] name if he is a man enough let him come
[4661.28] and debate me okay whoever this donkey
[4664.08] is that you keep mentioning your your
[4666.64] hero let him come to me okay there is no
[4670.04] need next time to mention him again
[4673.60] whoever he is if he's man enough is if
[4675.88] he's more mother than your mother AA if
[4678.12] he's more man than your mother AA let
[4679.68] him come to me I'll see what I will do
[4681.68] to him but if he's too coward is to come
[4684.84] now let him stay a
[4686.64] coward and this is the religion of Peace
[4689.52] in front of you guys remember what they
[4691.08] did to the Coptic
[4692.36] Christians on the beach remember when
[4695.20] they were strong enough when they had
[4697.68] the upper
[4699.64] hand then there is no need for
[4703.40] peace no peace
[4706.08] remember this REM reminds me of the
[4707.84] movie Independence Day with these aliens
[4710.00] remember when the president of the
[4712.36] United States asked that alien behind
[4715.60] the the the the the
[4720.20] window no peace the aliens said we are
[4724.08] strong enough no
[4725.72] peace no
[4728.36] peace now these are martys
[4731.12] exactly these are the true Christians
[4733.24] who never accept Islam and they
[4737.08] died as proud Christians
[4742.68] man this is Islam for you this is the
[4745.88] so-called religion of Peace in
[4748.12] power no peace when you're strong enough
[4751.28] for Muslims right Muslims yeah yeah I
[4754.20] know I know baby I know so Christians
[4758.12] Christians who are here in the west wake
[4760.44] up warn your children be true Christians
[4764.04] apply Ephesians the book of Ephesians
[4767.04] 5:11 it's time Christians to wake up to
[4770.84] warn your children against this
[4773.24] demonic political ideology that is
[4784.52] Islam K there's no need for you to come
[4786.92] up
[4788.76] Kai talking to the Christian kind
[4796.28] hi hello hi K are you still a muslim
[4800.68] okay that's not what I'm here to discuss
[4804.40] um what why are you here I just want to
[4806.88] say yeah uh um give me what like I will
[4811.80] tell you why I'm here um I don't like
[4815.32] the language you're talking about
[4817.76] Muslims but but listen like let me let
[4820.56] me tell you why it's it's not because
[4822.64] I'm taking it personally because
[4825.48] um for example I came from a city that
[4828.32] is now um ruled by uh te groups um in
[4832.68] north of Syria and I'm sure you know
[4834.44] what what that city is but I don't live
[4836.48] there anymore like I never lived there
[4838.96] actually my friend used to live there
[4841.96] and she is now a mental health
[4844.32] patient um because when she was nine um
[4848.20] she was walking and and then like one of
[4851.08] them like one of these te people um he
[4853.84] stopped her and she and and he hit her
[4855.92] because she wasn't uh covered up
[4858.28] properly and like a lot of Muslims that
[4861.92] that live there even though they're
[4863.44] Sunni Muslims they are suffering because
[4865.76] of these
[4866.92] extremists I kind of feel like you're
[4869.16] not distinguishing between the majority
[4872.36] of Muslims and the and the minority and
[4874.52] the ex
[4876.24] extremist my my family like since the
[4879.32] beginning of of the war I'm not going to
[4881.40] use that word again um from the
[4883.44] beginning of this of the events in in
[4886.08] Syria 2011 we were against um like
[4890.76] people being armed we were against
[4893.52] people um fight like fighting against
[4895.76] the government but like and and and we
[4898.60] are Muslims we are Sunni Muslims if you
[4900.84] saw me in the street like you're going
[4902.96] to know I'm a Muslim the way I dress the
[4905.04] way I behave but even Muslims like us
[4908.44] Muslims we are suffering because of
[4911.28] these people because these people are
[4913.20] the minority
[4916.28] and I know you don't think they're the
[4918.44] minority I know you you think that all
[4920.72] Muslims are waiting for an opportunity
[4922.56] to be like these people but the reality
[4924.76] no we don't we're not waiting for an
[4927.72] opportunity to be like these people we
[4929.48] hate them I I'd literally rather become
[4932.68] an atheist than than than be like these
[4935.24] people and these people on the screen
[4938.08] right yes okay I I yes mhm so these
[4941.92] people in black on the screen are they
[4943.76] not Muslims according to
[4946.48] you I they they for me I don't think
[4950.28] they they are Muslims I think they are
[4952.48] sick people who need to be eliminated I
[4955.64] I wish I wish um a strong Army come and
[4958.80] eliminate them and you see what happened
[4960.96] in in Lebanon like to to that te group I
[4963.92] was super happy my family were super
[4966.12] happy we literally distributed candy in
[4968.64] the streets we were like we were happy
[4970.64] like like like crazy right I I wish the
[4974.08] same thing happen to all these people to
[4976.04] anyone who who thinks he's entitled to
[4979.12] to to just hurt another human being for
[4982.60] for their religion I'm going to ask you
[4983.92] a very very honest question I'm going to
[4986.24] ask you a very sincere question let's
[4988.64] see how sincere you are how honest you

[5038.32] Islam but that's a off topic that's off
[5040.84] topic so this is why I will give you

[5825.00] protectors or helpers you are one of
[5830.88] them do you see it and if any anyone
[5834.72] among you take them as aah then surely

[5845.24] you catch
[5847.20] it uhuh uhhuh so that's why the Isis
[5853.52] guys when they started their campaign

[5860.52] and then they move to the yazidis and
[5863.44] and the Christians did you catch it
[5866.56] that's what Islam
[5868.72] is and if you go to the tap for chapter
[5871.32] 8 ayat 12 guys I Cath look what it says
[5874.04] on the screen and this is the Arabic IB
[5876.36] cath not
[5877.88] the sugarcoated version or a bridged
[5882.04] version of C this is the Arabic look
[5883.92] what it says that is the Ayah means you
[5887.80] Muslims be steadfast and strengthen
[5890.28] yourself against your enemies take a
[5892.20] screenshot guys so he he will always

[5972.16] catch it this is Islam 101 in
[5975.56] power not for you your religion for me
[5978.16] My
[5979.00] Religion so there is a difference
[5981.08] between Muhammad being
[5983.68] strong Islam being strong October 7
[5987.80] Islam
[5989.00] exactly being strong enough to
[5992.04] attack and weak
[5995.24] Islam if you're
[5997.88] weak for you your religion for me My
[6000.36] Religion for you Shish Kabab for me my
[6002.76] Shish Kabab but when you're strong Islam
[6005.20] becomes the number one terrorist
[6008.68] religion because they worship a
[6010.80] terrorist they worship Allah and his
[6013.48] Prophet who are
[6015.56] terrorists did you catch it that's Islam
[6018.04] for you that's stage three for you that
[6022.76] is stage three for
[6026.84] you that's Islam for you want your
[6030.08] children Christians in the west wake up

[6055.84] everybody who's against Islam and the
[6058.16] prophet of
[6062.16] Islam huge difference between Islam
[6066.56] strong Islam and D Islam and this is the
[6071.12] T of cath the Arabic okay what you see
[6075.08] here on the screen that I translated for
[6077.24] you all right
[6080.72] next bukari 17
[6083.76] 13
[6085.16] 7013
[6089.96] 7013 okay N abuur I heard Muhammad
[6093.72] saying I've been sent
[6099.20] with
[6102.36] ie okay I don't know why they write it
[6104.88] like this but anyway meaning IE the
[6106.96] shortest expression carrying the widest
[6109.52] meanings and I was made Victorious with
[6113.40] a what a translation what a beautiful
[6116.36] translation no why you Muslims are such
[6120.20] liars and deceivers because the Arabic
[6122.64] doesn't say
[6124.12] that I was made
[6129.36] Victorious now if I copy this and we go
[6133.28] to Google Translate to give you an idea
[6135.08] how they falsely
[6137.92] translate and I was made Victorious by
[6141.76] Terror
[6143.48] how is Muhammad made Victorious by
[6146.36] Terror so Muhammad is what a
[6149.64] terrorist this is why I said show me one
[6152.16] thing which Muhammad did do what Isis
[6155.24] and other vice versa did not do so is I
[6160.60] are doing what Muhammad
[6163.92] did they are the real Muslims not these
[6166.56] W to be Muslims here in the west these
[6168.52] hypocrite Muslims who will go first away
[6171.24] who are only Muslim by name
[6174.16] you think you when you live here in the
[6175.48] west you L among the kufar you take uh
[6177.88] Jews and Christians and kufar as your
[6182.60] aah you a real Muslim if Muhammad would
[6186.20] have been alive today he would washed
[6189.00] his hands from you you're not
[6195.12] Muslims Allah needs
[6198.40] money his Prophet need money and when
[6201.56] you have enough money you can can by
[6206.04] power and Islam with power is different
[6210.20] Islam than without
[6212.68] power so you see guys how they lie again
[6215.64] sahkari
[6217.40] 713 sahkari
[6219.92] 713 take notes that the Arabic says m i
[6225.00] meaning Muhammad I Was Made
[6230.80] Victorious through

[6236.84] says here this is false
[6242.96] translation false translation I Was Made
[6246.20] Victorious with
[6248.44] Terror through
[6253.48] Terror
[6256.68] Rob thank you very
[6260.36] much and here is more here is a guys
[6263.60] that you won't find
[6265.64] easily here's a Hadith on the screen
[6267.92] that you won't find very easily so I
[6270.48] want I'm here to share it with
[6273.28] you

[6284.92] have also the web based version okay
[6288.72] here's the web based version of the
[6290.60] Hadith that I about to show you uh uh
[6293.52] let's
[6294.32] see and here is the link that is the you
[6297.72] know
[6300.08] archive archive.org
[6304.12] I hope it's going to work if it's not
[6306.52] working you have to use the web- based
[6308.68] version okay of the following Hadith
[6310.88] that you see on the screen Abdullah
[6313.28] binar narrated and of course the Hadith
[6315.84] is
[6317.64] not
[6319.72] okay I was sent before the hour with the
[6322.56] sword who's saying that Muhammad
[6325.08] Muhammad the prophet of Islam I was sent
[6327.84] before the hour with the sword so that
[6330.36] Allah might maybe worshiped alone with
[6333.12] no partner and my Prophet with an i has
[6336.80] been placed under the shade of my Spear
[6339.64] and humiliation and disgrace have been
[6342.08] made upon whoever disobeys my command
[6346.16] and whoever imitates the kufar people
[6348.88] means the kufar he is one of them so
[6352.12] guys any Muslim listen carefully any
[6355.28] Muslim who lives in the west Among Us
[6358.04] the kufar we are called the kufar and he
[6361.44] pays us tax he lives amongst us he is a
[6366.72] CF he's one of
[6368.92] us so all of these cuti pies these
[6371.80] wanabe
[6373.08] Muslims the Mimis and the Lees and the
[6376.60] susus and the
[6378.40] Fifi all of them
[6380.68] are hypocrites they're actually one of
[6383.32] us and that's why the real Muslims in
[6386.80] power they will go after them first did
[6390.44] you catch it any hypocrite Muslim is
[6394.32] considered to be immediately a cafir
[6396.80] you're one of
[6398.88] them you're one of
[6401.40] them and you see my
[6404.00] Prophet has been placed under the shade
[6406.72] of my Spear and humiliation and disgrace
[6409.68] have been made upon whoever disobeys my
[6412.08] command and whoever imitates people me
[6416.20] kufar is one of them and the Hadith is
[6419.36] very very
[6420.76] very okay uh for people who want to see

[6425.92] on the screen here is the Arabic as
[6430.28] Well's

[6526.80] them except Islam otherwise they will
[6529.76] have nothing but the sword

[6570.36] link and you go to this website just
[6572.56] right click and choose English
[6574.32] translation if you use the browser
[6577.24] translation this is what you will get it
[6579.80] will not be exactly uh a good
[6583.24] translation but you'll get the idea
[6587.28] okay you'll get the idea
[6592.80] I was sent by The Sword in the hands of
[6594.60] the hour until Allah alone to be
[6596.76] worshiped you see it comes out a little
[6598.24] bit funny because it's a Google machine
[6600.68] translation okay this is translated by
[6603.00] Google
[6604.00] machine
[6605.64] okay and my
[6608.56] livelihood RIS was made under the shadow
[6611.84] of my Spear and humiliation and this
[6614.28] comes out a little bit funny humiliation
[6616.48] and disgrace were made against those who
[6619.32] violated my command who disobey my
[6621.68] command and those who liken him to
[6624.68] people no that's not what the Arabic
[6627.04] says the Arabic says if you imitate the
[6629.68] people if you imitate the kufar you are
[6632.68] one of them you're from you are with
[6635.80] them you are from them did you catch it
[6638.44] and the Hadith is what of course
[6643.08] authentic and even here it comes out a
[6645.56] bit funny you know what if I use Google
[6648.00] Chrome how will it come out let's see
[6650.08] because this is another browser maybe
[6652.28] Google Chrome is more uh close when it
[6655.92] comes to the English translation this is
[6658.12] Google Chrome let's see how it come
[6660.92] out right click
[6664.60] translate sometimes
[6667.04] from browser to browser it it it will be
[6671.40] different okay this one is not working I
[6674.68] don't know
[6676.52] why it's not
[6680.56] working okay page UNR concept you see
[6683.40] sometimes it doesn't work I don't know
[6685.96] why that is I don't know why maybe you
[6688.56] can try it from your but here it it
[6690.16] gives me a really
[6694.08] strange uh translate to English okay I
[6698.56] reopened it again and now it's working
[6701.16] see let
[6704.56] me why is this
[6707.40] happening why is this
[6710.12] happening why can't I make it bigger now
[6713.32] you see it becomes the page becomes
[6717.52] unstable but here it says I was sent
[6720.36] with the sword before the hour so that
[6722.64] Allah alone would be worshiped with no
[6724.76] partner for him my sustance was made
[6727.64] under the shade of my Spear and
[6729.12] humiliation this gra were made for for
[6732.68] whoever disobeys my command whoever
[6734.96] imitates a people is one of them so you
[6737.12] see from from browser to browser the
[6740.44] translation could be different so I
[6742.60] recommend you to use the Google browser
[6746.24] the Google Chrome browser to get the
[6749.08] most closest translation for this
[6754.40] Hadith do you see it very easy to
[6757.64] use all
[6760.08] right just to give you an
[6762.40] idea that's the same Hadith here on the
[6764.76] screen you see it all
[6767.92] right all you
[6770.16] believe as for the Arabs do not accept
[6772.52] from the except Islam otherwise they
[6774.08] will have nothing but the sword as for
[6776.72] the people of the book and The Magicians
[6778.52] except J from them so uh again show me
[6781.88] one thing that Muhammad and the
[6785.08] sahab did not do what Isis
[6788.12] did same copy
[6791.28] paste copy
[6795.24] paste and here is what Muhammad did you
[6797.96] see I found this illustration it might
[6800.28] be a little bit shocking for some people
[6802.60] but I'm happy that it's cartoonish and
[6804.44] not real but this this is what Muhammad
[6806.52] did to the Jews of qua Bena
[6810.60] tribe he checked their penties the young
[6814.08] boys he looked inside their penties and
[6816.72] he literally chopped off their heads
[6819.08] around
[6822.24] 800 adult men and young boys lost their
[6825.28] lives that day and Muhammad had a very
[6828.24] special
[6829.72] uh Team
[6833.16] like Omar and Ali they love chopping
[6836.08] heads off and that's what they did they
[6838.36] literally
[6839.76] dug in the
[6841.96] ground very huge Graves and they put all
[6845.12] of these people inside the
[6848.36] graves you see that's what they did to
[6850.84] the Bena tribe don't forget also to the
[6854.88] other
[6856.60] people who were only writing poetry
[6859.44] about him and criticized Muhammad what
[6861.36] he did to them he split a an old woman
[6864.96] in
[6866.12] half remember story
[6868.68] of what he did to
[6871.40] her he split her in half
[6875.68] literally see here we have for example
[6877.92] two camel this is an 80-year-old woman
[6881.04] he split her in half literally the old
[6883.20] woman in half only for writing poetry
[6885.64] and criticizing
[6887.64] Muhammad uh uh uh Muhammad was a CAF Rob
[6891.60] Christian for doing that torturing
[6893.28] people and aning people like that
[6896.20] Muhammad was a
[6897.60] cafir what Isis that they are kufar they
[6901.56] are not real
[6902.96] Muslims no no of course they are not
[6905.20] real Muslims what's the difference
[6907.48] between
[6909.36] Muhammad and the sahaba and Isis nothing
[6912.36] same same filth same crab
[6916.16] same as we say in Arabic same filth same
[6920.84] crap nothing is different that's what
[6923.36] Muhammad did story of is very famous
[6929.20] guys right the story
[6932.00] of 80-year-old woman Muhammad splitter
[6934.68] in F by binding her arms and feed to two
[6940.28] different animals one animal went that
[6943.32] way and the other animal went the other
[6945.96] way and she was literally split in half
[6948.64] Muhammad was not a real Muslim right
[6950.92] Muslims of today Ro Prophet was not a
[6953.24] real Muslim for doing this only because
[6956.24] this woman was criticizing
[6959.08] Muhammad yeah Muhammad was not a real
[6961.56] Prophet Muhammad was a cfir Muhammad was
[6964.20] not a real Muslim right
[6966.44] Muslims and look guys here is the
[6969.00] Hadith
[6972.08] look 444 here is the
[6977.68] link and there are multiple versions of
[6980.32] this Hadith I think the Hadith isif oh
[6982.68] no
[6983.48] it's regarding the Ben
[6988.32] look right he is a
[6992.84] Jew look what they did what he's
[6995.28] reporting I was among the captives of
[6997.52] the Ben okay the Jews of
[7000.40] benua they Muhammad's companions the
[7003.76] evil murderers examined us so guys they
[7007.24] looked inside this boys panties
[7011.24] literally they looked inside the young
[7013.88] boy's
[7015.76] panties and if they they found
[7018.68] pubes pubic hair between his
[7023.36] legs he would have been
[7026.12] killed so the little boys who had pubic
[7030.20] hair were un alive they were un alive
[7033.00] completely they cut off their heads and
[7035.44] those who had not were not and the ones
[7038.56] the little boys who did not have pubic
[7041.04] hair were spared
[7043.36] I am as among those who had not grown
[7045.68] hair do you see
[7047.20] it that's what Muhammad did 800 to 900
[7052.96] Jews were unived on the
[7055.80] spot and they dug Graves and put their
[7060.08] bodies and heads inside those
[7063.84] Graves what's the difference
[7070.96] between the these people in the black
[7073.44] and Muhammad and his
[7077.28] companions child abuse and murder
[7082.04] exactly Muhammad was sent as the mercy
[7085.40] for mankind yeah see how merciful
[7087.40] Muhammad
[7090.52] was exactly Winston nice to show you my
[7094.12] friend exactly you get the
[7096.92] idea do you see it that's what literally
[7100.00] happened in the sth century to the
[7102.96] Bena the youngs who
[7105.20] grew the young boys who grew pubic hair
[7109.80] chop off head of the Jews the
[7113.28] ones after inspection did not have pubic
[7116.60] hair yet they were spared and they were
[7118.60] sold as
[7120.00] slaves that's what happened to

[7275.60] what's the problem what's the
[7277.84] problem I think this guy is a little bit
[7279.88] slow what can he do when you are a
[7281.16] Muslim you must be slow
[7282.72] slow these are the people guys who live
[7285.44] here in the west these are the
[7288.88] Muslims this is what Islam does to you
[7291.28] when you're a
[7292.64] Muslim what's the problem what's the
[7294.84] problem with
[7296.40] murder you see people like these people
[7298.92] you know yeah it's loading the brains
[7300.28] are are still loading what's the problem
[7303.16] what's the problem with
[7304.52] murder yeah are you
[7310.60] serious I'm
[7314.84] regarding slavery in Islam guys it's a
[7316.88] very big topic I I can't fit it in just
[7320.36] one or two minutes but to give you an
[7322.84] idea when you become a slave in the
[7325.88] hands of
[7326.88] Muslims when you become an actual slave
[7329.80] in the hands of Muslims let's say when
[7331.60] they are in power this is what you are
[7334.48] as a slave if we go to the following
[7337.44] book called Al M okay if you go to the
[7340.92] book called
[7343.92] and I'm not sure if I can give you the
[7345.44] link if it's still working or not but
[7348.72] let's see if I can give you the link of
[7350.28] this
[7352.88] book uh where did
[7358.56] I okay I hope this the link will work if
[7362.56] it doesn't work then forgive me and then
[7365.28] link they deleted the link but I'm happy
[7367.52] though that archive.org still functions
[7370.28] so I have to go through all the links
[7371.60] again
[7372.60] that's going to take me a lifetime
[7374.32] because I have so many books but if the
[7376.44] link is not working forgive me guys I'm
[7378.80] trying in the book called Al volume 13
[7383.32] by very big Sunni scholar okay very
[7386.72] giant Sunni scholar classical
[7389.56] scholar on page
[7392.48] 49 it teaches that when you're a slave
[7395.00] you're an animal Muslims own you as like
[7398.68] let's say a cow like a cow or a goat
[7401.88] page
[7402.68] 49 and I will give you immediately the
[7405.08] translation
[7407.04] guys if the slave is taken prison if the
[7410.84] slave is taken as
[7412.60] prisoner he becomes the property of
[7414.88] Muslims so you know what slave is what a
[7419.40] property in the hands of
[7421.92] Muslims your
[7424.28] property when they come for you and
[7426.52] they're strong enough and they have the
[7427.84] upper
[7428.68] hand you'll become their property
[7431.48] because because it's a property that
[7433.32] have been monopolized and therefore
[7435.04] becomes property of the lters Muslims
[7437.04] are lutters like an animal so you're
[7439.64] what an
[7441.48] animal you're going
[7443.72] to be an animal in the hands of Muslims
[7446.96] who own you and if the Imam sees that he
[7451.00] must be unived because there is a hard
[7454.04] time leaving him alive it would be
[7457.16] lawful to unive him so you can take his
[7460.16] life on the spot okay because such a
[7463.40] person has no value he is like the
[7466.48] apostate you see
[7468.40] it he you
[7470.92] are and since we're talking about
[7476.08] apostates I hope you didn't eat
[7479.36] yet this is what they can do to
[7483.44] apostates yeah I know shahen tikt off
[7486.20] was flagged by the
[7488.44] Muslims it's okay
[7492.16] this not the first
[7495.32] time no
[7497.48] problem it's Halal to eat upost state in
[7500.92] Islam you can

[8460.32] children an enemy of Allah who fights
[8463.40] against
[8464.80] Islam and even if it's a young little
[8466.96] kid and even a woman you can eat
[8471.84] them that
[8474.84] human even if it's a young boy a young
[8477.44] child or a woman and eat them
[8480.88] do you say
[8485.04] it how is this a
[8487.64] religion how is this not a demonic
[8489.72] killed from Satan and here is another
[8491.36] book this is why I asked him earlier
[8492.76] what do you think about IMI he said he's
[8494.80] half
[8495.64] Muslim guys the classical Scholars
[8498.28] become HS of Muslims in their in their
[8500.28] hands modern day Muslims are doing te on
[8503.04] the classical Scholars like IM imagine
[8505.68] IM became a CAF
[8510.88] Imam and nawi the giant Sun scholar Imam
[8514.72] an nawi volume 3 page
[8518.56] 284 same
[8524.32] story if you even stop praying guys the
[8529.24] text here on the screen says if you're
[8530.80] are a Muslim and you stopped praying and
[8534.60] remember Muslims must pray five times a
[8538.08] day if you stopped praying
[8541.04] the five daily
[8542.80] prayers
[8545.40] Muslims Muslims practicing Muslims can
[8549.12] unive you they can un alive you and eat
[8553.12] you
[8555.28] translation it's permissible for a
[8557.72] Muslim a real Muslim not these hypocrite
[8559.68] Muslims here on the panel one of them
[8561.80] even called himself a Christian yeah
[8563.40] beautiful the Muslims must be really
[8565.48] proud about you after hearing what you
[8566.96] just said it's permissible for a
[8569.04] practicing Muslim a real Muslim who
[8571.20] forced out of hunger if you are hungry
[8573.48] there's no food to kill the fighter an
[8577.36] enemy of Islam an apostate and eating
[8580.36] him you can also kill and eat an
[8582.96] adulterer someone who commits adultery
[8584.92] in Islam so if you have a Muslim who
[8586.92] committed adultery not only Stone him
[8589.08] but also eat him you can eat a
[8591.24] fornicator you can eat a Muslim who
[8593.84] stopped praying the five daily prayers I
[8595.96] mean what's
[8597.04] left do you see what Muslims will do to
[8599.88] you
[8601.12] if you are a hypocrite you're an
[8603.20] adulterer forget about the Jews and the
[8605.16] Christians and the pagans forget about
[8607.40] them for a second so they will come
[8609.84] first after the non-practicing
[8613.72] Muslims so non-practicing Muslims who
[8616.76] are only a Muslim by
[8620.08] name who are considered to be Hypocrites
[8623.20] they are what hypocrite Muslims they are
[8626.56] hypocrite Muslims will come first
[8631.36] you see
[8633.20] it Muslims who don't pray five times a
[8635.76] day they can eat
[8639.64] you they will eat you if you don't pray
[8641.96] five times a day and this is what alar
[8644.96] university teaches guys from these
[8647.96] filthy books that you see on the screen
[8650.96] these filthy
[8657.32] books Muslims if you are bunch
[8660.40] Hypocrites you're going to be on the
[8662.08] menu when Muslims have the upper hand
[8665.60] when Muslims Implement Shar like Isis
[8669.24] did couple years
[8671.28] ago they will eat you and this is why
[8674.48] you remember that video guys have you
[8676.96] seen that video that I saw with my own
[8679.00] eyes one of these Isis
[8682.52] boys they were recording
[8685.00] it
[8687.08] he killed another Muslim Soldier from
[8690.76] the opposite side he cut off his heart
[8693.68] and he ate a
[8694.88] draw he ate the Isis boy cut off the
[8699.68] heart of the other Muslim out and ate
[8702.12] his heart raw you remember that video
[8704.56] that was circling on the internet I've
[8706.92] seen
[8708.60] it please tell me that these are not
[8710.76] real
[8714.32] Muslims eating humans raw that's Islam
[8718.12] for you guys
[8721.00] eat him raw no
[8734.36] problem eating them
[8739.92] raw eating another Muslim raw eating him
[8744.56] because he stopped praying their five
[8746.32] daily prayers
[8751.36] why because they are not considered to
[8752.72] be human beings anymore who are the real
[8755.24] human beings the only practicing Muslim
[8757.36] people like Dash the
[8760.72] Isis B Haram these are the real Muslims
[8763.36] not these Muslims who live here in the
[8765.16] west like the Mimi and the fared uh
[8769.76] response and Li dawa his boyfriend Li
[8773.12] dawa Ali dawa those are the not these
[8776.72] are kufar man they are not real Muslims
[8779.12] they act like Muslims but they are not
[8780.88] Muslims a real Muslim is what you see on
[8783.32] the
[8786.20] screen
[8800.92] right and where do you think guys they
[8803.36] take this from from the Quran of
[8805.80] course IM nawi and imini
[8810.44] got it from the Quran no way up of
[8813.08] course the Quran tells you to if you the
[8817.20] Quran tells you if you are hungry you
[8819.48] can even eat a
[8820.84] pig since the apostates they become like
[8825.60] animals they considered to be pigs this
[8828.12] is why people like IM nawi and Imam
[8831.48] shini said you can eat an
[8834.60] apostate because there is no difference
[8836.80] between a pig and an apostate did you
[8839.72] catch it
[8841.20] let us go to the Quran
[8843.84] look let's go to the
[8852.12] Quran to prove it from the
[8855.84] Quran look if we go to chapter 6 for
[8859.96] example Ayah
[8862.04] 119 so this is literally from the Quran
[8864.44] guys don't be too shocked look six and
[8869.28] even the chapter is uh suitable the
[8872.52] kettle the
[8874.40] kettle I am 119 and what you should not
[8878.24] eat of that meat on which Allah's name
[8879.92] has been pronounced at a time while he
[8882.24] has explained to you in detail what is
[8884.12] forbidden to you except now pay
[8886.52] attention at
[8887.84] accept this is why IM and
[8890.88] imini said what they said about apostate
[8893.44] eating them except under compulsion of
[8898.88] necessity I
[8902.64] so if there is no other food on the
[8906.08] table eat a human being out of you can
[8909.20] eat a
[8911.16] pork
[8912.96] Muslim if there is no food you can eat a
[8916.04] pig yet Muslims try to convince us that
[8919.56] you cannot eat pork but if they're
[8921.44] hungry there is no food on the table you
[8924.64] can eat a swine look chapter 61 145 as
[8927.64] well say I do not find it that which has
[8930.40] been revealed to me anything forbidden
[8932.08] for an eater to eat pay attention
[8935.68] except that it be what has died of
[8938.40] itself or blood poured forth or flesh of
[8942.88] swine for that surely is unclean or that
[8946.56] which is transgression other than Allah
[8948.96] having been invoked in but whoever is
[8952.44] driven to necessity not Desiring nor
[8955.76] exceeding the limit then surely your
[8957.52] Allah is Forgiven so if you eat a human
[8959.40] being or poor work if there is no food
[8961.68] on the table you're good to go just do
[8964.64] it if there is no food on the table you
[8968.64] are hungry you can
[8973.20] eat you can
[8977.28] eat humans apostates and pigs as well no
[8982.16] difference
[8983.28] between an apostate and a
[8986.16] pig do you understand how IM and imini
[8991.52] based their teaching they got it from
[8994.36] the
[8995.08] Quran chapter 6 ay 119 back to back with
[8998.76] chapter 6 I
[9006.00] 145 did you catch it and since apostates
[9010.12] are considered to be
[9012.08] pigs since the mush are considered pigs
[9016.40] you can eat
[9017.60] them did you know if the parents
[9020.12] Muhammad would have been alive today
[9022.84] Muhammad himself if Muhammad would have
[9024.84] been alive today and his parents would
[9026.24] have been he would have eaten his own
[9028.08] parents did you know
[9030.56] that Muhammad would have eaten his own
[9032.84] parents
[9033.96] yes look we go to the by IM and he also
[9039.16] imzi for chapter 9
[9043.96] 928 according to abas they are filthy
[9047.92] the mus are like like dogs and pigs we
[9051.68] know that the father and mother of
[9053.28] Muhammad died as
[9055.36] pigs they died as mus and since the mush
[9059.08] are NES and they are dogs and pigs
[9060.76] according Tob Abbas one plus one
[9063.16] Muhammad would have eaten his own mother
[9064.88] and his his own father according to that
[9067.96] logic Rob can you prove it yes
[9076.40] look 4718
[9086.68] 4718 said a man asked where is my Father
[9089.84] yasol Allah he replied your father is in
[9093.48] hell when Muhammad turned his back he
[9096.00] said my father and your father are in
[9099.04] hell so Abdullah is in hell right
[9101.60] Muslims and what about the mother of uh
[9103.96] Muhammad
[9105.92] am same
[9108.84] story chapter clarifying that whoever
[9111.80] died upon this belief then he's in
[9114.80] fire okay that's the chapter now uh
[9118.12] Muslim Muslim Muslim 203 and as reported
[9122.32] verely a person said Allah where's my
[9125.20] father he said he's in fire when he
[9128.20] turned away he he called him and said
[9130.56] verily my father and your father are in
[9132.64] hell so this is still about the father
[9135.40] of Muhammad now let's see about the
[9137.20] mother
[9138.68] okay see about the
[9145.04] mother visiting the grave of a mus
[9149.16] adulterer that's the chapter now let's
[9151.64] read about Muhammad's mother Hadith
[9158.56] is Ned Abu hura the father of the cats
[9161.88] Abu hura the messenger of Allah visited
[9164.40] the grave of his mother who died as a
[9166.64] mush and wept and caused those around
[9169.40] him to weep
[9171.20] he said I asked my Lord meaning Allah
[9173.80] for permission to pray for the
[9175.12] forgiveness for her for his mother Amina
[9178.84] and he did not give me
[9180.84] permission so Allah did not forgive
[9183.72] Amina for sh for dying as a
[9188.40] adulterers idolators you see it
[9192.36] idolator as a
[9194.48] mush mus
[9204.08] so 1+ one Muhammad would have
[9208.56] eaten his father and
[9211.52] mother maybe raw maybe barbecued
[9215.84] allaham you see
[9218.96] it and since the father and mother died
[9222.28] as n mush and and the Quran explains in
[9225.52] chapter 9:28 that
[9228.72] the Muhammad's father and Muhammad's
[9231.40] mother are dogs and pigs so if Muhammad
[9234.16] is the son is the son of dogs and pigs
[9236.08] what is he Muhammad must be iban pig or
[9241.92] iban dog that's Muhammad for
[9246.16] you you see how Muhammad insulted his
[9248.68] own father and mother guys what kind of
[9251.80] prophet insults his father and mother
[9254.16] and calls them dogs and
[9257.96] pigs what kind of prophet ET insults his
[9261.68] father and mother calls them dogs and
[9271.48] pigs you see it and Muslims are now all
[9274.36] of them are now
[9277.44] silent so ham AKA Momo turns out to be a
[9282.76] son of dogs and
[9284.36] pigs what make what does it make you if
[9286.72] you are a son of a dog and a pig
[9293.04] same
[9295.56] same what kind of man insults his father
[9298.52] and mother like
[9300.96] that not only are the father mother of
[9304.32] Muhammad NES filthy but they are also
[9307.56] dogs and
[9315.88] pigs well Alpha El Omega uh depends on
[9319.76] which Scholars you want to use you need
[9322.00] to understand there's something that we
[9323.84] call in Islam a scholar for a dollar
[9329.32] have you ever heard of that term before
[9331.20] a scholar for a dollar so when you
[9333.20] cherry pick which scholar you like let's
[9335.60] what they always do Muslims this is my
[9338.36] scholar that other scholar you know he's
[9340.12] classical scholar but I don't accept him
[9341.88] he has a different AKA he has a
[9343.84] different sect within Sunni Islam I
[9346.48] don't choose what he I'm going to cherry
[9348.40] pick which scholar I like a scholar for
[9350.36] a dollar that's what we call it a
[9351.64] scholar for dollar some Scholars said
[9354.12] that that Ayah is
[9355.68] abated okay some Scholars said that that
[9359.36] a is abated other Scholars said no it's
[9361.92] not abreg so depends on which scholar
[9365.20] you choose did you catch
[9367.68] it depends on which color you use and
[9371.56] the problem is this because Muslims
[9375.44] don't know anything about irrigation
[9377.40] even the classical Scholars I did a very
[9379.76] long complete live show about it
[9381.80] remember my recent live show about
[9383.52] agregation
[9384.96] guys remember my recent live show about
[9389.48] abreg we did an a live show a long live
[9393.00] show about agregation go watch it
[9395.40] recently okay go watch that live
[9399.48] show and we showed you that
[9404.56] even
[9407.24] even the scholars the classical
[9411.16] Scholars had no clue about agregation so
[9414.44] what do you think about Muslims of today
[9417.36] okay classical Scholars this is the last
[9420.00] show that I did guys classical Scholars
[9422.88] confused about
[9426.60] agregation and why is that Rob
[9430.40] because they are all over the place and
[9432.64] here is my proof on the screen if we go
[9435.04] to the book about abrogation in the
[9438.12] Quran byi
[9440.60] okay page
[9445.12] 55 okay see we have books
[9449.16] 515
[9451.28] 515 not sure if the link is going to
[9453.48] work but I will try to give it to you
[9455.28] anyway here is the link for the book if
[9458.72] it doesn't
[9459.68] work I can't help you for
[9462.88] now because archive.org was taken down
[9466.36] for a couple of days and a lot of links
[9467.88] are not working yet
[9470.12] pray that the links that I have here
[9474.52] that they will eventually work
[9476.88] again all right else we have to look for
[9480.08] new links and the website is still very
[9482.96] slow but here on the screen guys it says
[9485.60] that the scholars are all over the place
[9489.12] and you see here you have Arabic numbers
[9491.16] right guys some Scholars said there are
[9493.60] 214 ayas that are
[9496.20] abreg other Scholars said there are 13
[9499.52] four a in the Quran that are abrogated
[9501.84] other scholar said 213 other one other
[9506.68] scholar said that only 200 eyes are
[9509.20] arreated other Scholars said 66 you see
[9512.40] they are all over the place so if you I
[9514.24] can give you a translation which you
[9516.52] just saw on the screen to not butcher
[9518.68] you always with the Arabic
[9521.20] look look what the scholar said in the
[9524.04] book of IM about abrogation of the Quran
[9529.72] ji page 515 on the screen in the bottom
[9533.44] the number of cases meaning a of the
[9535.48] Quran in which abreg was reported by
[9538.12] classical Scholars who
[9540.64] preceded is as
[9543.20] follows anari said there are 24 ay that
[9546.52] are arreated in the Quran so much
[9550.12] later Medina period ay when Muhammad was
[9553.04] in complete power in full power abating
[9557.04] peaceful mean Paradise okay AB ja and
[9561.32] said there are only 134 ay that are
[9564.20] abated AB Sal said there are 213 ay
[9567.48] abated you see guys the classical
[9569.44] Scholars all all over the place they do
[9572.00] not agree which ayas how many ayas are
[9575.36] aggregated said 200 eyes are abated in
[9578.00] the Quran of
[9581.08] Allah he tried to lower the number down
[9583.92] he said only 66 eyes are abated I
[9587.40] Barakat said 210 a are arreated and I ji
[9592.44] himself the writer of this book I ji
[9596.20] said
[9597.44] 247 ayats in 62 chapters of the Quran
[9602.00] are
[9604.80] abreg so you see in other words guys the
[9608.68] classical Scholars forget about modern
[9610.84] day Scholars or mod day imams and
[9613.88] Sh classical Scholars on the screen do
[9617.08] not agree on on the amount of a that are
[9622.20] arreated so like I said some Scholars
[9624.44] will say some Scholars will
[9628.32] say that chapter 60 a 8 is
[9634.60] abated other Scholars this is what we
[9637.80] call a scholar for a dollar other
[9641.40] Scholars will say no it's not
