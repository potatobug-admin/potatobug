[1026.96] response the uh snitch himself who
[1030.12] leaked the emails about Yer when you do
[1033.36] a deep dive I'm a scuba diver when you
[1035.88] do a deep dive I'm a scuba diver things
[1038.80] get very very awkward and difficult when
[1040.80] you do a deep dive I'm a when you do a
[1044.40] deep dive I'm a scuba diver things get
[1047.60] very very awkward and we I'm more than
[1049.56] happy to go to go diving anywhere if I
[1051.84] were to give you a blank muscle not I'm
[1054.76] a scuba diver I'm more than happy to go
[1056.60] to go diving anywhere if I were to give
[1058.64] you a blank must let's not let's you're
[1062.08] pushing me I'm a scuba diver I'm more
[1063.96] than happy to go go diving anywhere if I
[1066.36] were to give you a blank must the
[1068.72] standard narrative has holes in
[1072.48] it that yeah yeah this snitch that you
[1077.24] see on the screen guys the snitch
[1079.96] himself fared snitched and leaked the
[1084.12] emails about his fellow brother in Islam
[1088.16] the Dr Yas kadi
[1091.20] Mr HS understand that narrative himself
[1095.28] yes this guy here this snitch on the
[1097.84] screen did it this is why we call him
[1100.92] fared
[1104.24] leaks I mean that interview with
[1106.92] Muhammad hij went viral and as you may
[1111.24] know you know the quote by now what has
[1113.88] been seen on the internet cannot be
[1117.40] unseen and Yadi both
[1120.64] Yadi and Muhammad hijab tried to delete
[1124.28] the video but we already downloaded it
[1127.04] before they deleted it it's not on their
[1129.48] YouTube channels anymore but we have
[1131.24] their that
[1133.08] interview Muhammad hijab even tried
[1135.48] before deleting and he removed 30
[1137.72] minutes 30 minutes the last 30 minutes
[1140.68] the most embarrassing part and he had no
[1143.76] other option but to delete the entire
[1146.72] interview because many Muslims started
[1149.64] to doubt Islam they doubt started to
[1152.60] doubt Islam and many became
[1156.28] apostates so what you see what you hear
[1160.68] in 2024 from the daag Gand like fared is
[1164.56] nothing but damage control the the
[1167.80] remaining damage control the damage
[1170.52] control the the damage that was left by
[1173.84] Muhammad hijab he made the worst mistake
[1176.92] in his life inviting Yadi but Yas kadi
[1181.72] forgot that he was being recorded he was
[1184.60] too
[1185.96] honest too honest and when he was asked
[1190.48] by Muhammad hijab if I'm going to give
[1192.52] you a blank mus a blank
[1195.52] physical copy with no ink on the pages
[1200.16] no text yet
[1202.28] which are you going to put on
[1204.96] it
[1206.48] said don't push me I can't say I can't
[1210.80] give you an
[1212.72] answer in other words not the Quran not
[1217.00] the Quran not
[1219.48] the ETC not not
[1223.60] any as we love to call them any
[1227.08] version right
[1230.12] emotional damage exactly baby
[1232.68] emotionally damaged Muslims had to
[1235.96] become apostates and guys as you know a
[1238.60] huge tsunami an avalanche is
[1242.80] coming your way Muslims and it will
[1246.08] knock over the umah and you can't do
[1248.28] anything about it look what's going on
[1251.08] lately look what s it to to the DA
[1255.84] scene Brother Sam uh onean
[1260.20] Army destroyed the entire dawa scene of
[1263.76] all the daag Gand and as you notice they
[1267.16] are Lally trying to do damage control
[1269.76] fared is doing it the Muslim Lantern is
[1272.80] doing it all of them are trying but they
[1275.04] are failing miserably the umah is going
[1277.96] to end mark my words guys as we speak in
[1281.24] the Middle East where Islam started many
[1283.80] Muslims are leaving Islam arabic
[1285.96] speaking Muslims people who live in the
[1288.16] middle e East I mean look at the Moses

[1447.80] screen bukari
[1449.40] 3219 we can read brothers and sisters we
[1453.00] can read in Hadith number
[1455.88] 3219 it says narrated Abbas Allah's guys
[1460.92] look how
[1463.04] much fixing I had to do in the false
[1466.04] English translation do you see it it's
[1468.40] front of you why Muslims always lie in
[1471.16] their
[1472.52] translations I had to fix Apostle into R
[1477.16] so Allah's rasool said Gabriel I had to
[1480.76] fix it into jiel jiel read the Quran to
[1484.36] me in one har one letter so har guys for
[1488.40] the people who do not know harf is the
[1490.60] singular form of a and Har means a
[1495.92] letter just one letter a letter har okay
[1500.12] har baby it means letter letter so the
[1505.32] Arabic says har not way or a dialect
[1510.48] okay bunch of liars in this and
[1512.72] specifically guys whenever you see
[1514.68] something words between brackets it's a
[1516.88] big fat line it's not in the Arabic so
[1519.76] in one okay and I continued
[1525.60] Muhammad continues asking him who
[1528.84] jel the demon jel who was squeezing him
[1535.14] [Applause]
[1540.84] in yeah you know the incident squeeze
[1543.80] squeeze maybe you know jiel wanted some
[1546.68] uh ketchup out of Muhammad he kept
[1549.24] squeezing him and he kept saying I
[1551.32] cannot
[1553.08] read you're not giving me anything to
[1555.40] read from brother brother jel brother
[1557.84] stops pleasing me
[1559.56] man anyway and I continued asking him to
[1563.08] read it
[1566.52] in in what seven look how much I had to
[1572.60] remove from the fal translation guys all
[1576.44] of this is bunch of
[1579.12] Lies I continued asking him to read it
[1582.36] in
[1583.72] seven look at the false translation man
[1587.04] what's left
[1589.24] in the Arabic it's talking
[1592.40] about
[1593.92] and singular and
[1596.20] plural
[1598.04] singular plural
[1601.88] seven
[1603.52] one and as explained literally mean in
[1607.24] the Arabic language letters meaning

[1782.72] I will not I will not go easy on you
[1785.32] fared so let's see guys what he said in
[1787.20] one of his recent videos actually this
[1790.04] is his last video Let's see what he said
[1792.20] guys everybody Focus let me turn up the
[1794.48] volume for our brothers and sisters on
[1796.80] Tik Tok and let's see hear what he said
[1800.20] but actually let's get into some of the
[1801.48] responses that were brought forward um
[1803.64] against my video um and in my previous
[1806.16] video I was speaking about the and the
[1807.88] position of the scholars and here's what
[1810.56] hatun had to say
[1813.44] to to coming up with uh coming up and
[1817.88] saying yes people are disagree regarding
[1820.28] what meaning of ouru is and there are 40
[1822.80] different opinions in the 21st century
[1825.60] I'm coming up with my opinions and my
[1828.36] interpretation and this is what it is
[1831.24] it's dialect but also certain
[1834.48] differences now I don't know if there's
[1836.48] an issue with Hat's hearing maybe apus
[1839.84] distracted her I'm not really sure Abdul
[1843.00] stop insulting people get to the
[1846.44] point you see guys these people have no
[1849.28] uh decorum they have no honor they have
[1851.00] no
[1852.24] dignity you know uh the dust underneath
[1856.00] the shoes of sister hatun that Muslims
[1858.52] tried to
[1860.16] step in London in that Park the dust
[1864.00] under her sandals or feet is more clean
[1867.60] than you and your Prophet together was
[1870.88] hearing maybe apus distracted her I'm
[1874.08] not really sure because again I
[1876.72] mentioned quite clearly in my video that
[1881.40] is upon the second view I mentioned the
[1883.80] name of a scholar so there's no reason
[1885.64] for her to say that I'm coming up with a
[1887.44] new Theory
[1889.04] says that um the modes are seven and the
[1893.92] guys notice how he's calling the modes
[1897.24] let me pick some you know you know I
[1899.76] think Satan is there still up your nose
[1902.32] and according to the Sunnah Satan uh did
[1905.72] number one in your ear last
[1907.92] night uh
[1910.00] uh look at his tongue look at the tongue
[1912.44] look at the eyes
[1914.80] fared like
[1918.20] a shame on you why are you lying to your
[1922.48] glial Muslim audience why are you cherry
[1926.04] picking what a 10th Century scholar guys
[1929.96] he's mentioning a tahawi tahawi is a
[1932.80] 10th Century scholar
[1935.00] man when did Muhammad live when did the
[1937.96] sahabah live in the seventh
[1941.48] century are you are you kidding me so
[1944.88] you're mentioning a 10th Century scholar
[1947.64] by the name of a
[1949.16] Twi a tahawi you are cherry-picking one
[1952.00] of the 40 and you know what let me put
[1954.40] you political correct one of the 35
[1957.92] different scholarly opinions for what
[1961.36] theu could have been what what the could
[1964.16] have meant you're choosing
[1966.76] one of
[1968.72] the many opinions many sayings and
[1972.52] that's it are you're going to call it
[1974.68] modes what modes I challenge you to show
[1978.32] me one authentic Hadith from the mouth
[1980.12] of your Prophet saying that theu are
[1984.04] modes or theu are
[1987.56] dialects show
[1989.56] me so what he's doing is guys he's
[1992.36] quoting a 10th Century scholar a 10th
[1995.40] Century scholar giving his human own
[1999.40] opinion and they call them Scholars for
[2002.24] what theu could have meant 10th
[2006.60] Century okay can you imagine guys 10th
[2009.32] Century
[2010.76] scholar claiming that these could have
[2013.36] maybe meant dialects maybe they are
[2015.16] Styles or ways or uh modes cherry
[2020.40] picking one of the 40 or 35 because guys
[2025.24] the so-called Scholars the
[2029.20] scholars
[2031.28] gave 35 to 40 even on the number they
[2035.60] cannot agree
[2037.84] says personal
[2041.24] opinions for what
[2044.60] theu could
[2047.80] mean
[2050.88] imagine can you
[2053.60] imagine
[2055.92] literally but of course he's not going
[2057.92] to say that to his gal Muslim audience
[2060.92] can you
[2062.24] imagine
[2064.24] modes dialects
[2068.44] you don't know do you you don't know
[2070.28] what it mean so guys again he's
[2072.28] mentioning a scholar from the 10th
[2074.84] Century a personal opinion because
[2077.84] muhamad never said what the were mention
[2081.28] the name of a scholar so there's no
[2082.96] reason for her to say that I'm coming up
[2084.80] with a new Theory says that um the modes
[2089.52] are seven and these are dialects as so
[2094.20] AWI a 10th Century scholar giving his
[2097.24] own personal opinion who came three
[2100.32] centuries later literally guys three
[2102.00] centuries later to explain what Muhammad
[2105.12] did not explain can you imagine a 10th
[2108.76] Century scholar explains what Muhammad
[2111.32] the false prophet of Islam did not
[2113.52] explain and you're going by a personal
[2116.84] explanation
[2118.84] right H what are the seven you know what
[2122.28] let me cherry pick one of the 35 or 40
[2126.12] sayings of the So-Cal
[2128.40] Scholars and uh not Allah Allah knows
[2132.36] best no Scholars knows best Islam is the
[2136.32] religion of opinions and saying of
[2138.92] Scholars truly guys because without the
[2141.16] scholars there is no
[2144.56] Islam yet they claim the scholars are
[2147.84] not upon us you bunch of liars and
[2150.48] deceivers you bunch of liars and
[2152.88] deceivers let me continue for any other
[2156.76] words that actually influence the
[2158.88] meaning then these fall outside the
[2161.72] seven modes they are revealed by allaha
[2164.96] however they just fall out of that okay
[2168.00] we heard enough we heard enough yeah we
[2171.52] heard enough we heard enough enough
[2174.68] enough y y
[2176.24] y
[2178.04] guys to summarize to give you an idea
[2181.72] maybe you are new to Islam or maybe this
[2183.64] is you know guys I know all of my live
[2185.88] streams as you know if if you have been
[2188.48] watching me for months or years now all
[2190.84] of my live streams are academic okay so
[2193.44] I'm trying to dump it down for people
[2196.84] for the specifically for the Muslims are
[2198.68] watching because remember 99% of all
[2202.08] Muslims have no idea what uh fared is
[2204.84] talking about anyway so to dump it down
[2207.92] a little bit I wrot I wrote literally I
[2211.00] created this slide for you read with me
[2213.96] what fared is trying to say farid's Bank
[2217.64] ccy for the defense of the seven what
[2220.96] he's trying to say is Muhammad did not
[2223.48] explain my Prophet did not explain what
[2225.76] the seven are take a screenshot guys but
[2229.76] IM who died in the 10th
[2232.80] Century right a 10th Century scholar
[2236.92] imagine did explain perfectly what
[2242.08] Muhammad did not explain perfectly and
[2244.32] left out even the sahab had no idea what
[2247.16] the seven
[2248.04] were because remember when OB heard
[2251.48] where for the very first time when he
[2253.48] heard that there
[2254.92] are different
[2258.28] different he said I never been in
[2261.44] doubted I never been in doubt like the
[2264.48] do that I had in the pre-islamic period
[2267.80] Jah that's obey for you guys who
[2270.04] Muhammad told you to go to for regarding
[2273.64] or learning the seven uh sorry learning
[2276.04] the recitations of the Quran
[2278.12] Abdullah Mas
[2279.88] oby and the freed slave of ab Sal four
[2285.04] four of them okay that
[2288.48] obey was immediately uled just like the
[2291.88] Muslims who left Islam after that
[2293.68] interview with Yas kadi and Muhammad
[2296.80] mojab or moob call him whatever the
[2299.52] golden showers boy
[2301.88] right ubb K started to doubt how can
[2306.04] this be Muhammad claims that he's the
[2308.48] final Prophet so even one of the main
[2311.32] companions OB
[2313.36] said I have doubts and what happens guys
[2317.20] Muhammad lays his hand on him literally
[2320.48] he beats him with his hand on his chin
[2322.72] he says don't doubt this is what jiel
[2326.00] did to me he gave me
[2328.84] seven if I was
[2331.44] smart and if I was obey in his shoes I
[2335.08] would have asked y tell us what this
[2337.84] seven no answer I forgot to say
[2341.40] inshallah so jel did not tell me jel did
[2345.08] not tell me what the seven are brother
[2348.08] so imagine guys Muhammad never explained
[2351.44] what the seven are now after 1,400
[2356.72] years Muslims are trying to figure out
[2359.80] still trying to figure out what the
[2361.72] seven are because Muhammad did not
[2364.44] explain it we don't have any Hadith from
[2367.64] the mouth of Muhammad even not even
[2370.52] oneith what the seven are or the seven
[2373.68] letters are because mean letters okay
[2378.32] guys no side topics
[2381.08] please Focus this is the way to
[2387.68] expose the the quranic preservation the
[2392.40] and last but not least the da this like
[2396.44] far fared Alik okay so fared is going to
[2402.16] a 10th Century
[2404.44] scholar he's choosing him for some
[2406.56] reason
[2408.64] IM to perfectly explain what Muhammad
[2412.16] did not explain to his companions yet
[2415.72] Scholars as I explained disagree we have
[2420.20] 35 to 40 even on the number they
[2424.08] disagree imagine 35 to 4 40 different
[2428.20] sayings or opinions better to say it or
[2431.08] call it for what the seven could have
[2434.36] been or might
[2437.12] be wow wow wow emotional damage I would
[2443.72] be emotionally damaged and left Islam by
[2445.76] now if I was true to myself because you
[2448.40] will not hear this from the Muslim dawas
[2451.00] on their channels we have to help the
[2453.60] Muslims out if they are willing to
[2455.76] listen to what we have to say
[2458.56] the other
[2460.56] side Muslims when are you going to stop
[2463.72] to only listen to these liars and
[2465.64] deceivers that you call the dies and
[2469.20] Scholars and students of knowledge call
[2472.80] them whatever you want to call them I
[2474.20] don't
[2476.20] care wake up my Muslim friends I do not
[2479.40] hate you I love you I only ask you to
[2482.12] listen to what I have to say and then

[2492.72] own homework God gave you a beautiful
[2496.88] set of brains use
[2499.20] them do not allow anyone to do the
[2501.72] thinking for you I know that Islam
[2505.04] came dictated to you as the scholars say
[2513.00] it's it Islam came
[2515.68] dictated and not through through logic
[2518.20] in Islam you can't use logic can you
[2520.68] imagine that this religion teaches that
[2523.60] you cannot use your human logic you can
[2526.32] only use what has been given to you

[2944.44] anyway right he said let me make it
[2948.16] bigger so you can take a screenshot of
[2949.56] my translation Abu ban said people
[2953.76] meaning Scholars the people here
[2955.96] supposedly are
[2959.12] Scholars Scholars disagreed in 35
[2962.68] sayings for theu
[2967.68] in the other book it was 40 now it's
[2971.88] 35 is it 40 or uh 35 brother which one
[2976.60] is it pick your
[2981.84] cherries I mean come on
[2988.04] man come on
[2990.42] [Music]
[2992.76] man are you serious right
[2995.64] now so you see guys they don't even know
[2998.64] how many explanations were there from
[3002.16] Scholars who
[3004.44] tried much later Scholars try to make
[3007.76] sense out of the seven aru because like
[3010.72] I said Muhammad never explained what the
[3013.12] seven were to the sahabah they had no
[3016.48] idea nobody knows nobody cared to even
[3019.88] ask
[3021.52] Muhammad what are the seven you claim
[3024.16] that jel gave you the Quran in seven
[3026.80] what are the seven letters what what are
[3028.76] the seven no answer
[3034.92] Allah nobody knows even Allah doesn't
[3037.84] know if Allah had the answer he would
[3039.32] have given it by now to his
[3041.80] Prophet but no answer so it's nothing
[3045.16] but a game of guessing
[3048.68] 40 or maybe 35
[3052.00] Allah so if you continue on the next
[3054.44] page page 33
[3057.28] page 33 of the same book look in the
[3060.24] bottom 33 we go up look what it says so
[3064.84] as I mentioned people so guys I gave you
[3067.76] the translation and uh the this part
[3070.28] continues on the next page as you see 35
[3074.48] sayings on top 35
[3078.48] sayings
[3081.08] and he continued
[3083.36] saying
[3084.92] that IM
[3088.52] the he
[3090.44] mentioned
[3092.08] only five of them so guys this is now
[3097.00] now it becomes pure comedy this is
[3099.04] nothing but pure comedy from the
[3104.28] so-called classical Scholars why so guys
[3107.92] it started to 35 35 says then it became
[3112.68] 40 and IM Al himself
[3118.52] mentioned
[3119.96] only five sayings of what the could
[3127.24] have
[3133.20] meant
[3135.24] right what the seven aru could have
[3138.56] meant or what Muhammad tried to say so
[3142.76] is it 35 is it 40 or five which which
[3146.60] one is
[3147.64] it which one is
[3151.36] it it's nothing but a circus exactly it
[3154.84] became a a comedy literally guys the
[3157.32] seven aru what I'm trying to say is the
[3159.36] seven aru
[3162.20] became a toy in the hands of the
[3167.40] soall
[3169.24] scholars Islam is a toy in their hands
[3171.76] literally
[3173.08] guys is it 40 is it 35 or 5
[3177.12] five IM
[3179.88] Al only mentioned five and then he
[3183.40] continues right who continues saying Abu
[3187.64] as you see here continued saying that
[3190.68] the the scholars have disagreed they
[3195.16] disagreed
[3198.36] on theu on the
[3201.08] seven in 35
[3205.16] saying so
[3207.48] then again 35 the number 35 is
[3210.92] mentioned 40 35 5 and now 35 again and

[3788.20] Muhammad's revealing the Quran they're
[3790.32] memorizing passages of the Quran they're
[3792.04] memorizing their prayers but he revealed
[3793.88] it in all these different ways and not
[3796.04] one person ever
[3798.00] noticed until now and then he tells them
[3801.64] oh yeah for all these two decades where
[3804.04] I've been revealing the Quran to you
[3806.00] yeah I've been telling it to you in
[3807.40] seven different ways and this is another
[3810.84] baseless assumption so the prophet peace
[3812.76] be upon Him is in meah um for the
[3815.08] majority of his prophethood in Makkah
[3817.72] guys are you are you understanding
[3819.56] what's going on brother David wood my
[3822.60] dear brother in Christ brother Dr David
[3826.52] wood said a very important thing what
[3829.36] you need to know is that I'm trying to
[3831.24] dump it down for everybody please guys
[3833.32] don't get offended when I use such
[3836.00] terminology I'm trying to make it more
[3838.68] easier that's what I'm trying to say for
[3840.16] everyone right
[3842.60] Muhammad became a
[3844.84] prophet in the
[3847.36] year 610 right guys if you have
[3851.72] studied you know Islam a little bit you
[3853.96] should know the numbers by now in the
[3856.28] year 610 ad Muhammad became a prophet he
[3860.04] was around 40 years old he stayed in
[3864.72] Mecca for at least at least a decade
[3868.52] right at least and then he migrated to
[3874.92] the city or The
[3877.28] Village at that time it was called
[3880.24] y when Muhammad conquered it he named it
[3883.28] to Medina okay
[3888.20] Medina
[3890.32] okay
[3893.16] Medina and for 20 years
[3896.52] the sahaba who came with him they only
[3900.40] had one half one half nothing more just
[3904.24] one letter right guys one letter and I
[3908.16] will explain soon to you what is going
[3911.48] on what I want you to know is guys for
[3914.60] at least 20 years for 20
[3917.96] years there was only one one Quran
[3921.84] supposedly what is the nobody knows what
[3925.24] is that nobody knows J never explained
[3928.68] it Muhammad never explained it to the
[3931.04] sahaba but the sahaba while they are in
[3934.76] Mecca together with Muhammad there was
[3936.20] only one har for 20 years when Muhammad
[3939.48] went to Medina and people started to
[3942.44] convert there in
[3946.36] Medina there was an
[3948.48] incident an
[3950.44] incident and that
[3952.88] incident was between Omar and a guy
[3956.88] Omar when he passed by he heard someone
[3959.00] praying reciting the Quran in a
[3962.04] different way and Omar learned it from
[3966.48] Muhammad when they were in Mecca so Omar
[3969.32] grabs him by the throat he puts you know
[3971.84] a piece of clothing around her neck to
[3973.60] to choke him Omar started literally guys
[3978.04] choking the guy he says how dare you
[3982.24] Omar
[3983.88] said how dare you to recite the Quran in
[3987.56] a different
[3988.92] way than Muhammad the
[3992.04] prophet taught us so Omar obey all of
[3997.52] them abdah all of them didn't
[4000.28] know what not sure about OB though I
[4003.16] know about abdah I know about Omar
[4005.92] because they were
[4011.40] meccans they only had one har what
[4014.56] happened
[4016.08] much later in Medina the rest of the
[4019.72] sixu came down total number of seven
[4024.96] seven letters right seven letters of the
[4028.80] alphabet are you getting it
[4031.80] guys so this is why someone like oby the
[4035.76] famous oby kab when he heard all these
[4039.36] people reciting Quran differently he
[4042.16] started to immediately D do
[4045.84] went into his
[4048.24] heart doubt imagine the forget about y
[4053.96] doubting obey himself the famous
[4057.12] companion Muhammad command the sahaba to
[4059.56] go to regarding the recitation of the
[4061.52] Quran obey himself started to doubt
[4064.72] until Muhammad lay hands on him and said
[4067.48] do not
[4070.04] doubt
[4072.08] imagine in a nutshell what's going on so
[4074.76] let's let's let me play the video more
[4076.88] guys this is important stuff I want you
[4078.72] to focus telling the Quran to you yeah
[4081.08] I've been telling it to you until now
[4083.24] and then he tells them oh yeah for all
[4085.52] these two decades where I've been
[4087.52] revealing the Quran to you yeah I've
[4089.52] been telling it to you in seven
[4091.16] different ways and this is another
[4094.04] baseless assumption so the prophet peace
[4096.00] be upon guys uh they flagged my live
[4098.36] stream on Tik Tok didn't I tell you that
[4101.00] it's going to
[4102.04] happen but it's okay guys it's okay baby
[4106.84] we did enough damage on Tik Tok already
[4110.00] guys Muslims are so scared they don't
[4113.40] want me to send out the
[4116.00] message what yes you heard it correctly
[4118.44] guys my live stream on Tik Tok went down
[4121.68] why because they flagged massively
[4123.88] flagged my live stream again did I say
[4126.08] anything wrong

[4131.44] Unfortunately they can't do that on
[4133.16] YouTube though YouTube is is not that
[4136.48] political correct yet we'll see what
[4138.20] will happen in the future if we have to
[4139.80] move to other platforms but till now
[4142.08] YouTube has more balls than the people
[4145.24] behind Tik Tok they will try to use and
[4148.32] abuse the algorithms against you by
[4150.08] flagging by falsely
[4151.72] flagging video or live stream on Tik Tok
[4154.48] this is why I hate Tik Tok with a
[4156.16] passion I hate it but I go on Tik Tok
[4160.04] because there are too many uh Stone
[4163.32] lickers and smoochers there pay
[4166.36] I mean Muslims there Muslims try keep
[4169.48] trying it's not going to
[4171.20] work anyway let's see if I have

[4232.28] continue guys all all of you focus we
[4234.20] don't care he tells them oh yeah for all
[4236.52] these two decades where I've been
[4238.52] revealing the Quran to you yeah I've
[4240.52] been telling it to you in seven
[4242.20] different ways and this is another
[4245.04] baseless assumption so the prophet peace
[4246.96] be upon Him is in meca um for the
[4249.32] majority of his prophethood in mecah he
[4251.96] only has mechans around him why would he
[4254.28] be reciting in different dialects in the
[4256.20] first place as they
[4264.24] idiot enough with these
[4267.64] lies enough with these
[4272.32] lies your hadiths are
[4275.44] full that Muhammad used to forget Quran
[4279.40] your Prophet your false prophet because
[4281.28] he's a scammer because there is nothing
[4283.84] called Allah Muhammad is Allah and even
[4286.64] in one of my recent short videos a shh
[4290.88] from alar explained that Muhammad is
[4293.00] Allah and Allah is Muhammad stop
[4296.36] man your false prophet because he's a
[4299.12] scammer he's a liar and a
[4301.72] deceiver he used to forget ay he for he
[4304.88] used to forget even entire suras
[4307.72] claiming that Allah caus them to forget
[4310.80] so yeah the reason is because Muhammad
[4313.56] used to forget
[4316.24] that's why he came with the
[4318.32] LIE sent the Quran in seven in
[4323.60] Medina
[4325.64] right after two decades after 20
[4330.80] years enough man enough with these lies
[4333.24] man we are seeing through you and we can
[4336.48] refute anything you say Abdul majority
[4338.96] of his prophethood in mecah he only has
[4341.68] mechans around him why would he be
[4343.80] reciting in different dialects in the
[4345.44] first place as David correctly pointed
[4347.60] out um it was it was during the time
[4350.16] ofam
[4351.24] Bam's um acceptance of Islam that Omar
[4355.12] first realized that there are different
[4358.00] that there are multiple modes well the
[4360.36] natural assumption is that these did did
[4362.52] you hear again how he used
[4364.48] modes like stop if you have any honesty
[4368.84] in you left in your whole body stop with
[4372.20] the modes and the Styles and dialects
[4374.36] stop nobody knows what theu are nobody
[4378.00] knows even your Prophet didn't know stop
[4381.04] man multiple modes were revealed very
[4383.84] late into the prophit hood and that
[4386.24] makes sense because that's when you had
[4388.48] multiple tribes from different regions
[4390.48] converting to
[4392.40] Islam disgusting liar what a
[4395.92] disgusting liar you are yeah you are
[4399.16] disgusting
[4400.72] individual guys again he was referring

[4407.96] debate
[4409.56] anyone sitting in his uh

[4447.36] everybody Focus all jokes aside we know
[4450.56] Islam is nothing but a pure comedy but
[4452.40] let's try to focus narrated Omar the
[4456.52] Omar himself the killer himself Omar I
[4461.52] Omar heard ham Bim the same ham Bim that
[4465.48] just mentioned moments ago
[4470.36] reciting during the lifetime of Allah's
[4473.60] messenger so Muhammad was still alive
[4476.60] and Omar heard a guy called Hisham bin
[4481.32] reciting one of the suras called suran
[4484.32] in the Quran okay he was reciting it I
[4488.36] Omar guys Focus I Omar listened to his
[4491.68] recitation to whose recitation ham
[4495.72] and I noticed that he was reciting in a
[4499.00] way that Allah's messenger had not
[4501.80] taught me so Omar is going crazy Haywire
[4506.68] Omar is going
[4509.60] nuts he's he's about to jump the guy and
[4513.08] he was I was about to jump over him look
[4517.16] guys at the wording Omar was about to
[4519.68] take off his head literally Omar
[4525.80] wanted to chop off this
[4531.44] guy's his
[4534.20] head literally I was about to jump over
[4537.56] him while he was still in prayer so the
[4539.68] guy the poor guy was reciting Quran he
[4541.88] was
[4543.20] praying and he wanted to un alive him
[4546.00] literally to take off his head but I
[4548.64] waited Omar says I waited patiently so
[4552.00] he had still some respect for the Quran
[4555.52] right he waited patiently until the guy
[4558.96] meaning hisam Bim finished his prayer
[4562.08] finished reciting you know whatever he
[4564.24] was reading
[4565.92] Froman then Omar says I put my sheet so
[4570.16] guys he took a sheet around his neck he
[4574.48] he literally tried to choke
[4577.76] him taking him by his neck dragging him
[4581.00] literally with his feet over the floor
[4583.80] all the way to Muhammad
[4586.52] and said so Omar asked him but while
[4590.24] literally putting his hands on him who
[4594.04] has taught you yeah ham B who has taught
[4598.32] you this
[4599.24] Surah which I have heard you reciting

[5316.04] the seven appear how and when did the
[5318.96] seven started to
[5322.20] appear in
[5324.44] Islam as you heard Brother David
[5327.48] wood for 20 years the companions recite
[5331.56] the Quran in only one half from from the
[5334.40] year 61080 when Muhammad supposedly
[5337.32] became a prophet all the way to January
[5341.24] 6:30 0 so two decades guys 20 years
[5345.16] we're talking about 20 years okay 20
[5348.12] years the sahabah used to only recite
[5350.72] the Quran in one letter one what is that
[5354.28] letter nobody knows no one knows again
[5357.44] no one knows what the har
[5362.52] singular or far nobody knows they're
[5367.00] only picking their
[5369.72] cherries they are trying
[5373.72] flavors okay between 610 and 630 ad the
[5378.52] beginning of 630
[5380.40] ad there was only one half and that's
[5383.40] why the sahab are going crazy right obey
[5385.80] started to adopt right obey himself
[5388.92] started to ADT when he heard about all
[5391.28] of these different different whatever
[5393.68] you want to call call them uh uh uh uh
[5397.36] uh Omar went
[5400.36] crazy right as we read earlier and
[5403.40] wanted to kill the
[5407.60] man
[5409.96] uhuh why are you reciting the Quran
[5412.84] differently than Muhammad taught us in
[5415.16] the beginning with the one
[5416.80] har then what's going on is guys already
[5422.24] in these 20 years
[5424.72] over more than 95% of the Quran is
[5428.28] already revealed guys
[5431.12] 95% of the entire
[5434.04] Quran is already revealed supposedly
[5438.08] from jel uh from Allah supposed to jel
[5440.88] and then to Muhammad
[5443.32] right uhhuh step by step guys as you
[5446.96] see what happens is guys chapters like
[5449.92] Surah 9 Sur Toba or five Surah Al ma are
[5455.48] the last chapters that Muhammad
[5457.84] supposedly received in the final two
[5461.08] years supposedly the final let's say
[5463.24] years of his life when he died a cursed
[5467.36] death at the hands of the Jewish woman
[5469.64] according to the Sunni sources right by
[5473.64] poisoning and he said I feel that my art
[5476.44] has been cut from The Poisoned food that
[5478.56] I ate at
[5480.08] kba
[5482.12] right uhuh so for 20 years there was
[5487.04] only one one Quran one what is that
[5490.16] nobody knows what is that letter nobody
[5491.76] knows but 95% is already revealed
[5495.72] Muhammad in the year 630 guys Focus
[5498.44] everyone take screenshot and
[5500.40] focus step number three or or Point
[5503.52] number three Muhammad gets himself an
[5506.80] army
[5508.48] and backstabs his own family his own
[5511.52] tribe and attacked Mecca secretly in the
[5515.08] year 630 do you see
[5517.20] it this is after 20 years heam as we
[5521.44] mentioned in the Hadith as we read in
[5523.20] the Hadith Isam Bim converts to Islam in
[5526.40] that same year in
[5529.36] 630 guys he he here the problem starts
[5533.12] from now on pay
[5536.00] attention the problem is
[5538.56] [Laughter]
[5539.96] heam the problem is
[5542.64] ham he
[5546.04] guys heam
[5549.12] bin he heard he heard that Muhammad is
[5552.92] coming with an army and he will kill
[5554.92] anyone and everyone if they they do not
[5557.16] convert to Islam when he is about to
[5560.28] conquer Mecca hamim is warned by
[5565.28] abas the uncle of Muhammad warns
[5568.24] himam please convert to Islam or
[5570.68] Muhammad will kill you he will butcher
[5572.64] you literally guys that's what's going
[5574.72] on okay so he had no choice either die
[5579.84] or
[5581.40] else The Sword in other words the sword
[5583.92] on your
[5585.32] neck you think these people converted
[5587.64] because of Islam is the truth no they
[5591.60] converted out of fear for their lives
[5595.84] you're getting it right guys you're
[5597.56] slowly getting haa Mikey likey
[5609.76] Islam did not start because it was the
[5612.88] truth now Islam started to grow because
[5615.68] of the sword on people's
[5617.68] necks uhhuh
[5621.80] uh-huh so ham Bim converted to Islam in
[5625.32] the year 630 out of fear not because he
[5628.32] believed that Muhammad is a true prophet
[5630.40] he recited his Shah I love to call it sh
[5634.60] sh his
[5636.36] flipflop sh in the year 630 ad okay and
[5641.44] then the problem started to appear
[5643.80] That's why the sahaba started to doubt
[5646.20] and you know Omar went crazy I'm about
[5648.48] to kill you that's the same guy right
[5651.40] that we read earlier that muham that
[5653.92] Omar took by the
[5655.84] throat that's the same guy right guys
[5658.32] you see it same
[5661.04] guy so in the year 630 ad hisam converts
[5664.72] out of fear to Islam and Muhammad in
[5668.16] many ay and hadiths we see that Muhammad
[5670.64] is forgetting ay and he blames Allah for
[5672.60] it Allah made it happen and whenever a
[5675.60] companion came to remind him or he hears
[5678.08] a an Ayah being recited Muhammad said I
[5681.28] forgot it I forgot it Allah caused me to
[5683.56] forget it ah could that be the reason
[5687.36] why we have so many
[5689.12] different seven started to appear why
[5692.56] clearly the only reason is Muhammad is
[5694.40] forgetting his own Quran and he says
[5697.32] Allah's fault exactly for her he blamed
[5699.84] Allah for it can you imagine Allah caus
[5701.92] me to forget it Allah caused me to
[5704.04] forget such and such and such Ayah or
[5708.44] Surah and he claims that there's
[5711.12] something called
[5712.88] abreg abreg is Muhammad's damage
[5716.68] control for Muhammad forgetting
[5719.96] Quran Muhammad had an answer for
[5722.16] everything seven
[5724.16] abreg brother this is why he tried to
[5727.04] cover up all these nasty contradictions
[5729.32] in his Quran calling it abreg and
[5732.20] whatnot yeah yeah yeah we're slowly
[5734.68] getting it Rob Christian I'm happy I'm
[5736.80] so happy that you're taking notes guys
[5739.28] so when Omar as we mentioned earlier in
[5741.44] the Hadith Omar hears hisam bin reciting
[5745.48] Quran differently Omar chokes him he
[5749.04] takes him by the throat and drags him to
[5752.08] Muhammad yeah Muhammad this guy is a big
[5754.52] fat liar he's corrupting the Quran he's
[5756.96] reciting Quran different than the way
[5758.60] you taught us and Muhammad said both of
[5762.44] you recited and both of them recited it
[5766.08] and Muhammad says the Quran was sent
[5768.08] down in
[5769.56] seven seven okay not modes seven letters

[6049.00] the and their meanings but far's final
[6052.64] and only desperate bankrupt argument for
[6055.92] the difference in meaning is they all
[6059.56] complement one another look at these
[6062.04] meanings how they're comp complimentary
[6063.80] and how they add to the meaning of the

[6112.76] sometimes
[6117.44] here's part two of this series so if you
[6119.84] missed part one go watch it you can find
[6122.68] the link in the description box the da
[6125.08] boys like fared after all of these years
[6128.16] are now forced to come clean and admit
[6131.16] that there are differences in the and
[6133.40] their meanings but far's final and only
[6137.08] desperate bankrupt argument for the
[6139.60] difference in meaning is they all
[6142.16] complement
[6144.12] one another look at these meanings how
[6146.04] they're complimentary guys if if this is
[6148.52] not a liar that I don't know what a
[6150.68] meaning is of a liar I mean uh the way
[6154.04] he says it right he is giving it away
[6157.12] that he is
[6159.36] lying compliment each
[6161.84] other complimentary the meanings Are all
[6165.48] uh you know together when you put them
[6168.36] together they complement one
[6170.80] another yeah I I mean
[6173.72] I mean glory to Christ guys by listening
[6177.48] to the kid you can hear that he's
[6183.20] lying all
[6185.88] compliment one another look at these
[6188.32] meanings how they're comp complimentary
[6190.12] and how they add to the meaning of the
[6191.32] text which is of course a big fat lie
[6196.00] and here's why the early Sal did not
[6199.36] agree with modern day Muslims guys I had
[6201.72] to I had to put that in
[6204.36] I mean he's proud you know complementary
[6207.28] and how they add to the meaning of the
[6208.52] text which is of course a big fat lie
[6213.16] and here's why the early Sala did not
[6216.52] agree with modern-day Muslims like fared
[6219.24] they did not think highly of other K or
[6222.28] readings simply because they implied
[6224.80] their own human logic and even rejected
[6228.48] some of the readings that did not sound
[6230.96] logical to them but way
[6233.80] are the other readings not a revelation
[6235.68] from Allah as well oh boy yet the early
[6239.40] Muslims rejected them anyway maybe our
[6242.28] friend fared here can do takir on the
[6244.92] early Muslims if he claims to have a
[6247.88] spine in his body so here is my proof we
[6251.12] can find this information mentioned by
[6253.12] renowned Sunni Scholars like the mui in
[6257.20] his tapir the reading to in Surah
[6261.88] 37:12 with the dama attributes surprise
[6265.44] to Allah and ignorance is impossible for
[6269.20] Allah and that's why some of the early
[6271.52] Muslims rejected this
[6274.28] reading
[6276.76] against with a and Subhan Allah every
[6281.16] time you find a difference in meaning
[6283.40] you'll find
[6285.12] some amazing reason behind it and in the
[6289.36] book volume 12 page 492 sh Islam
[6295.60] himself explains that early Muslims I.E
[6298.80] the Sal used to make
[6302.16] mistakes guys let me stop the video
[6305.76] there
[6308.80] Islam
[6311.80] calls the sah and the and their
[6318.92] students people who make mistakes
[6325.40] Islam himself who came seven centuries
[6329.00] later is saying that the sahabah are
[6330.76] making
[6332.24] mistakes the
[6334.08] sahaba learned the Quran version
[6337.48] supposed the seven whatever you want to
[6339.12] call them they learned them directly
[6342.04] from
[6344.36] Muhammad andn who came 7 centuries later
[6347.64] says that the sahaba and their students
[6349.92] made
[6351.56] mistakes I mean this is funny man
[6354.52] literally guys is doing kufur in other
[6358.16] words on the sahabah and yet they call
[6360.44] him sh Islam funny stuff mistakes wow
[6366.56] wait wait wait IU who came seven
[6371.12] centuries later claims that the seventh
[6373.88] century and eighth Century Sala who
[6377.12] learned the recitation directly from the
[6379.44] prophet and the made mistakes just wow
[6384.80] remember this is the sh of talking Islam
[6389.68] continued saying that some of these
[6391.96] early Muslims used to even reject
[6395.16] certain wait I thought that all of these
[6398.16] complement one another they're
[6400.96] complementary yet the early sal sal
[6404.16] means guys the early three generation of
[6406.64] Muslims they call them
[6409.12] a the Sal used to re
[6413.80] certain certain
[6417.16] readings and cherry pick which reading
[6419.88] of the Quran they
[6422.00] liked why because some readings were not
[6426.68] right they did not sound logical to them
[6430.20] they chose they picked their
[6434.56] cherries
[6436.80] choosing over other kir what does that
[6440.80] mean poof
[6443.52] that lie that fared is now selling his
[6446.04] glial audience his Muslim glial audience
[6449.48] that lie that he's selling them
[6451.00] deceiving his audience saying that they
[6453.76] complement one another it's a big fat
[6455.64] lie because if these meanings these
[6459.20] different meanings
[6460.88] in if they were complimentary then why
[6464.12] are the S the early Muslims rejecting
[6467.92] certain K that did not make sense to
[6471.56] them uhuh
[6474.36] that some of these early Muslims used to
[6476.52] even reject
[6478.24] certain and he mentions a a student of
[6484.04] the rejected a canonical reading for
[6487.56] Surah 37 ay 12 that says Allah is
[6491.04] shocked and his reasoning for rejecting
[6493.76] that different is Allah cannot be
[6497.28] shocked do you see guys how the
[6500.16] different
[6501.28] meanings different
[6503.52] do not compliment one
[6505.84] another it's not possible for Allah to
[6508.76] be shocked I thought that farida said
[6512.04] Fara
[6514.00] said all of these different meanings in
[6519.48] the
[6525.24] different compliment one
[6528.76] another what complimentary what what
[6533.24] andus on the
[6535.72] side the early Muslims are saying these
[6539.28] these different and different meaning do
[6541.36] not make any sense they are not possible
[6544.16] Allah cannot be shocked what does far
[6546.68] trying to shove down our
[6548.92] throats the with the different meanings
[6551.88] complement one another how are they
[6554.24] complimentary while the sahabah and the
[6557.56] are literally rejecting
[6559.96] them complimentary poof are out of the
[6563.44] window in the garbage in the bin where
[6567.40] it belongs with the rest of the lies and
[6569.92] deception else we have to accept that
[6572.88] Allah is ignorant like any human being
[6575.84] so yeah fared should anyone listen to
[6578.28] you Oru and the Sal who rejected quranic
[6583.20] readings that did not sound logical to
[6586.12] them so what do you mean that different
[6588.40] readings or different meanings
[6590.72] complement one another look at these
[6592.96] meanings how they're comp complimentary
[6594.72] and how they add to the meaning of the
[6595.96] text the early Sala did not agree with
[6598.40] you my friend so why are you deceiving
[6600.92] your glial Muslim audience have some
[6603.96] decorum you'll find
[6606.52] some amazing reason behind
[6609.28] it get some you are lacking wisdom yeah
[6614.40] and on the next page himself mentions
[6617.16] chapter
[6619.12] 13m used to also be rejected by faith
[6622.72] famous companions
[6627.72] like and the cousin of the Prophet
[6631.32] himself used to read it
[6634.84] as instead and in the authentic Hadith
[6638.36] we can find the reason for that
[6640.56] according to IBN Abbas The Scribe made a
[6643.88] mistake an error because guys sleepy
[6648.56] scribe corrupted the Quran according to
[6651.32] IB Abbas and that's that's why IB Abbas
[6654.00] rejected that reading what happened that
[6656.44] same mistake is now in the Quran the
[6661.32] 1924 the 1924 Ciro Edition which they
[6665.44] call the H
[6667.76] Quran the Quran is
[6670.80] corrupted by a sleepy scribe brothers
[6674.80] and sisters this is not me saying it
[6677.08] this is even Abbas saying it let me go
[6679.72] back a little bit guys this is
[6681.24] devastating
[6683.84] devastating guys I want you all all of
[6686.36] all of you focus focus page himself
[6690.00] mentions chapter
[6692.44] 13 used to also be rejected by famous
[6696.40] companions like
[6701.04] ab and the cousin of the Prophet
[6704.64] himself used to read it
[6708.16] as instead and in the authentic Hadith
[6711.68] we can find the reason for that
[6713.92] according to Abbas the Scribe made a
[6717.24] mistake an error because he was sleepy
[6720.72] or drowsy yet we find that mistake now
[6723.92] in the most popular reading the 1924
[6727.52] Cairo Edition I.E the Quran and in
[6731.56] another
[6733.08] Ayah used to be rejected and read
[6735.84] instead by the early Muslims
[6739.04] as you see guys there is nothing called
[6744.88] complimentary
[6747.76] complimentary where's the complimentary
[6752.00] uhas
[6753.72] fared
[6756.76] complimentary the early Sal are
[6759.48] rejecting
[6761.04] different left right and center and you
[6763.88] talk you dare to talk about
[6768.56] complimentary do you see guys how the
[6770.88] early Muslims the early Muslims had no
[6775.44] high expectations they did not care
[6779.00] about all of these different K they used
[6782.00] to cherick what made sense to them you
[6784.96] know what this sounds logical to me I
[6786.80] will take this and I will throw that
[6789.12] other away and they even almost came to
[6792.36] blows guys whenman was in power when he
[6796.52] became the kff rightman himself who
[6799.64] burned the qurans thatman
[6802.96] the Muslims were attacking the
[6804.72] Christians in the two countries aeran
[6808.04] and
[6808.76] Armenia they were trying to conquer this
[6812.16] the countries aeran and
[6816.80] Armenia and not only were they fighting
[6819.60] the
[6820.68] unbelievers they were fighting each
[6822.68] other they almost came to blows because
[6826.72] they used to say to one another my
[6828.80] quranic reading is better than yours you
[6830.76] are reading a different full quranic
[6833.12] reading and they were about to un alive
[6835.28] each other kill each other over it when
[6838.08] the news reached
[6840.52] K he had to do something what did he do
[6843.76] he created Five new
[6847.28] copies he commanded
[6849.56] zabit to recollect the Quran again all
[6852.68] over again and write five perfect copies
[6856.52] and what did he do he burned all the
[6860.20] existing original
[6862.84] manuscripts and M personal copies of the
[6866.52] sahaba let's say put them on a huge pile
[6869.64] and burn them to the ground barbecuing
[6873.08] original qurans why to
[6877.12] hide the
[6879.60] evidence to hide evidence and one of the
[6882.52] reasons for the assassination of a man
[6885.36] is people claim that he corrupted the
[6887.72] Quran with his own hands when he ordered
[6890.44] Z to recollect the Quran
[6893.32] and burn all the originals to the ground
[6896.56] they said we are going to kill you
[6898.84] because you corrupted our qurans you
[6901.44] corrupted the Quran you burned our
[6905.28] qurans and we're going to kill you for
[6908.00] it and I did the live show about it guys
[6910.76] couple weeks ago go watch it about the
[6913.08] assassination of Kale man right Muslims
[6917.84] came to blows read instead by the early
[6919.88] Muslims
[6921.32] as bah andu T also explains that some of
[6925.60] the early Sala likeu Mas remove chapters
[6929.96] 113 and 114 the last two chapters from
[6933.96] their
[6934.96] personal which are also known
[6937.92] as imagine two suras two entire chapters
[6942.88] of the Quran completely removed by the
[6945.40] sahabah yet can now be found again in
[6948.68] today's H Quran and
[6952.68] saying early Muslims like obey the
[6955.64] sahaba added two extra suras guys here I
[6959.24] made a typo as you see here on top it

[7542.08] mistakes AA
[7544.24] said these
[7547.28] are grammar
[7550.48] mistakes the these three different ayas
[7553.68] contain grammar
[7556.36] mistakes
[7558.72] and according to AA who told this man
[7561.76] about it she said the
[7565.00] scribes this is the work of the
[7573.96] scribes the of who the book of who of
[7577.40] Allah the
[7579.64] scribes made G
[7584.28] mistakes in the book of Allah what book
[7588.36] of course the
[7590.16] Quran so guys the new copy ofman
[7594.44] according to AA when she saw it when she
[7596.84] started to be asked about it she said
[7600.56] there are three grammar
[7602.84] mistakes and these grammar mistakes of
[7605.28] course are still in the
[7609.04] Quran of
[7611.68] today as well look chapter 5
[7626.08] 69 says should
[7633.32] be so we have a grammar mistake what is
[7636.28] the grammar mistake guys what is the
[7639.08] grammar mistake in the
[7643.72] uh
[7645.92] right which means the nominative
[7648.68] accusative and
[7650.04] genitive
[7652.88] okay the way you put the literally
[7656.16] changes the grammar
[7658.72] completely
[7661.72] uhhuh
[7663.40] uhhuh a grammar mistakes according to
[7668.32] and the Hadith is authentic as any
[7672.80] or
[7678.00] Muslim who are the
[7681.60] bukari bukari himself and his student
[7685.48] Muslim so it's very very very authentic
[7708.72] any
[7709.96] Muslim any Muslim will say Rob you're
[7718.76] lying herself admitted it
[7722.28] guys so guys forget about the for a
[7726.00] second forget about
[7727.56] the the Quran became so corrupted in the
[7731.16] hands of of the Muslims the Muslims the
[7733.80] early Muslims corrupted the Quran so
[7735.68] badly that they even left grammar
[7738.08] mistakes in it how can the so-called
[7741.80] preserved
[7744.16] Quran contain grammar mistakes and these
[7747.52] are only some examples I have many
[7750.20] more this is just three
[7754.76] examples so what can we say horanic
[7758.36] preservation
[7760.41] [Music]
[7762.76] big fat line big fat
[7767.00] line big fat
[7769.84] line and even the scholars admit that
[7772.52] there is nothing
[7775.28] called if you have watched that
[7777.36] interview between Mimi hijab and
[7780.76] Y Mimi hijab mentioned his
[7784.72] shikh shikh
[7786.72] Akram shikh Akram the shikh of Muhammad
[7790.00] hijab okay shikh
[7793.68] Akram
[7796.88] admits that there is nothing called Mass
[7801.76] transmission is a big fat lie he
[7804.36] literally denies
[7805.84] it Mass transmission is a big fat
[7815.84] lie big fat lie so what does that mean
[7818.76] guys Muslims have no legs to stand on
[7822.92] Muslims have no legs to stand all of it
[7825.28] is a big fat lie horanic preservation
[7827.96] huge fat lie
[7831.28] fabrication I.E Mass transmission lie
[7835.72] what's left
[7838.88] nothing what's left of Islam
[7841.92] nothing nothing nothing nothing and in
[7846.28] the same book guys on page
[7849.48] 470 same
[7853.64] page
[7856.04] 470 we have another report
[7859.08] from where AA
[7862.52] says where AA says she claims that there
[7866.96] are 200 ay missing and let me give you
[7870.76] the
[7871.92] entire
[7876.56] Hadith from AA okay from Aisha
[7881.80] herself
[7883.28] said the
[7885.28] following can I put it no it's too
[7891.64] long let me split it in two parts the
[7894.64] translation what you see on the
[7898.20] screen that's the first
[7903.16] partak herself
[7905.64] said which means chapter 33 right guys
[7909.36] is 33 was receiv cited in the time of
[7913.40] Muhammad with
[7916.40] 200
[7918.60] verses and the Hadith continued saying
[7923.28] the last part of the
[7924.92] Hadith when wrote theic mus what is left
[7929.48] of that Surah is what we have now so
[7931.96] what does that mean guys AA says the
[7935.12] original Aisha said in other words the
[7939.48] original Surah
[7942.68] which is chapter
[7943.96] 33 used to be 200 ayas in total right
[7949.92] the total number of ayas were 200 if we
[7953.40] go
[7954.16] toah today's that you see on the screen
[7958.04] look chapter 33 we scroll down all the
[7960.92] way to the end to see how many eyes
[7962.88] there is only 37 do you see
[7966.52] it so what does that mean according to
[7969.64] AA if we do -
[7972.88] 73 is what do we get if I pull up my
[7979.96] calculator if I pull out my calculator
[7983.12] here's my calculator or let me make it a
[7985.00] little bit
[7987.48] bigger
[7989.28] Look 200 according to AA the original
[7993.88] amount of AAS in chapter 33 was 200
[7996.64] total minus today's 73 AAS according to
[8001.88] Aisha 120 ay are
[8007.80] poof gone why gone because man removed
[8013.68] them removed them man removed 120 ay not
[8020.92] abated guys don't confuse it with

[8024.28] agregation by giving the command to
[8027.24] zitman removed 120 a from chapter
[8036.25] [Music]
[8038.88] 33o emotional damn
[8047.48] itman corrupted the Quran so we have
[8051.20] scribes who introduced grammar mistakes
[8054.96] we have corrupting the Quran even
[8057.84] further by removing 120 ayats from
[8061.32] chapter
[8062.48] 33 you see it it's on the
[8065.00] screen

[8075.68] Quran all of them ate the Quran guys how
[8079.40] many people know

[8886.48] Edition is based on
[8890.68] no manuscript did you know
[8894.60] that the 1924 Cairo Edition which they
[8898.52] call now the HS Edition ition did you
[8901.60] know that when the scholars of Alazar in
[8904.28] 1924 the scholars of Alazar in Cairo
[8908.88] Egypt did you know that they did not use
[8912.04] any classical
[8914.76] manuscript when they put
[8917.56] that joke of a new edition together they
[8922.28] didn't base it on any manuscript did you
[8924.48] know
[8925.80] that Ryan says no way yes way
[8931.00] they did not use any manuscript when
[8935.08] they put that
[8936.84] 1924 chiro Edition together which is now
[8940.48] the number one popular
[8942.96] reading no manuscript for it was
[8946.12] used no manuscript for it was
[8949.16] used that's why the haves version of
[8957.72] 924 disagrees
[8961.40] contradicts call it whatever you want to
[8963.28] call
[8964.16] it it literally
[8966.72] contradicts with any existing
[8972.40] manuscript for the
[8977.36] Quran so guys they literally destroyed
[8982.28] themselves the house version disagrees
[8985.28] with any existing manuscript why why
[8989.72] because because they did not use
[8992.28] any classical
[8995.04] manuscript they
[8998.24] literally fabricated it
[9002.52] basically they found some text there and
[9005.84] they you know they did something with it
[9007.60] and poof we have a 1924
[9011.08] Quran so what can we say guys what is my
[9013.80] final
[9014.92] thought my final thought
[9017.84] is my grandpa
[9021.28] is older than the
[9025.76] Quran my
[9028.68] grandpa is older than the
[9032.52] Quran and I'm not lying to
[9035.24] you you know me guys when I say
[9037.48] something I say it as it
[9040.32] is my grandpa is older than the
[9045.56] Quran what you Muslims have in your
[9048.08] possession in your hands what you in
[9050.24] your masks and in your
[9052.16] houses is not a Quran it's not a
[9057.28] Quran and it's not even the Quran of
[9062.80] H it's not based on any
[9066.08] manuscript it's literally a fabricated
[9069.00] book it does not agree with any
[9072.04] manuscript no existing manuscript was
[9076.36] used when they put it together in 1924
[9080.24] it's literally a
[9084.12] creation that's what it
[9087.16] is nothing no no no Ryan nothing Ryan
